<h5 class="lg125">PREFACE.</h5>

  <p>When I decided to read a paper before the Ornithological Congress of
  1905 on Extinct and Vanishing Birds, I found it necessary to illustrate
  my paper by a number of drawings. These drawings roused special interest
  among those who listened to my lecture, and I was asked by many if I
  could not see my way to publish the lecture and drawings, in book form,
  as these plates were far too numerous for the proceedings of the
  Congress. After some hesitation I determined to do this, greatly owing to
  the persuasion of the late Dr. Paul Leverkühn. The preparation of a book
  required considerably more research than the lecture, and therefore my
  readers will find, in the following pages, a totally different account to
  that in the lecture, as well as corrections and numerous additions. The
  lecture itself has been published in the "Proceedings of the IVth
  International Ornithological Congress."</p>

  <p>I wish to thank very heartily all those of my ornithological friends,
  who have kindly helped me with the loan of specimens or otherwise, and
  especially Dr. H. O. Forbes, Dr. Scharff, Professor Dr. K. Lampert, Dr.
  O. Finsch, Professor Dr. A. Koenig, Dr. Kerbert, Mr. Fleming, Dr. von
  Lorenz, and others.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">INTRODUCTION.</h5>

  <p>The study of the forms of life no longer existing on the earth, from
  the scanty remains preserved to us, has provoked a very great interest
  almost from the commencement of historical times. The very small portion
  of this vast field I am treating of in the following pages has a special
  attraction, as it deals to a great extent with forms familiar in a living
  state to our immediate forefathers and even to some of ourselves.
  Although I have here arranged the species systematically, they fall into
  two distinct categories, namely those known externally as well as
  internally, and those of which we know bones and egg-shells only. Under
  the former category might be included those merely known from
  descriptions or figures in ancient books, as well as those of which
  specimens exist. In the present work several plates have been
  reconstructed from such descriptions in order to give some idea of their
  probable appearance. There is considerable difference of opinion as to
  the approximate date of the disappearance of many of the species known
  from bones dug from deposits which have been variously determined as
  pleistocene and post-pleistocene. It seems to me that this problem can
  never be entirely solved, but the significant fact remains, that while
  many bones of these species in one locality have been collected in the
  kitchen-middens of the former inhabitants, in other localities the same
  bones occur in what seem to be much older formations.</p>

  <p>In view of this and kindred facts, I have mentioned many species which
  some ornithologists will probably consider outside the range of the
  present treatise, viz., birds which have become extinct in the last
  seven- or eight-hundred years. Taking my first category, viz., those
  species whose exterior is more or less known, our knowledge is very
  variable in scope; about some we have a very full and even redundant
  literature, such as the Great Auk, the Labrador Duck, and Notornis, while
  of others, such as most of the extinct Parrots from the West Indies, the
  "Giant" of Mauritius, the "Blue Bird" of Bourbon, and so forth, we have
  the very scantiest knowledge. Even in the times of Leguat and Labat there
  must have been many species, now extinct, of which no mention has ever
  been made, for <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>these old writers only mentioned such
  species which impressed themselves on their memories either from their
  size, peculiar shape, beauty of plumage, or excellence and usefulness for
  food&mdash;in fact the culinary property of the various birds seems to
  have been their principal interest. One of the most interesting phenomena
  connected with recently extinct birds is the resemblance of the fauna of
  the Mascarene Islands and that of the Chatham Islands in the possession
  of a number of large flightless Rails, though the significance of this
  fact has been much exaggerated.</p>

  <p>On the whole, this book is confined to species actually known to be
  extinct, but a few are included of which a small number is still known to
  exist, because firstly there seems no doubt that they will vanish soon,
  and secondly, as in the case of <i>Notornis</i>, it was necessary to
  clear up certain misconceptions and contradictory statements. In the case
  of a few species believed to be quite extinct, it is possible that some
  individuals may still exist in little known parts of their range, while
  on the other hand it is more than likely that several of the species
  referred to in my lecture (Proc. Orn. Congress pp. 191-207, 1907) as
  threatened with destruction, have already ceased to live. This may also
  be the case with some birds not alluded to at all.</p>

  <p>In several instances I have treated of extinct flightless species
  under genera including existing species capable of flight. This may
  appear to be inconsistent, seeing that I maintain <i>Notornis</i>
  separate from <i>Porphyrio</i>, but, while not considering flightlessness
  in itself a generic character, the great development of the wing-coverts
  and the modification of the toes appear of sufficient generic value in
  this case. I know that several of the most eminent ornithologists of the
  day, among them Dr. Sharpe, differ from me, and are convinced that the
  loss of the power of flight is so profound a modification, that it is
  imperative that we should treat it as sufficient for generic
  distinction.</p>

  <p>While agreeing that many genera are founded on much less striking
  modifications, I cannot concur in this opinion, for, unless the loss of
  the power of flight is also accompanied by other changes, in some cases
  it is difficult to find at first sight even specific differences other
  than the aborted wings.</p>

  <p>The cause of recent extinction among birds is in most cases due
  directly or indirectly to man, but we also have instances of birds
  becoming extinct for no apparent reason whatever.</p>

  <p>Man has destroyed, and is continually destroying species directly,
  either for <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageix"></a>{ix}</span>food or for sport, but also in many other
  ways he contributes to their destruction. Some species have been
  exterminated by the introduction of animals of prey, such as rats, cats,
  mongoose, etc., and we know that also the acclimatisation of other birds,
  such as the mynah, etc., has proved to be harmful to the native birds.
  Again we find that the introduction of domestic creatures or others kept
  as pets has brought diseases which may prove fatal to the indigenous
  fauna. Another means by which man causes immense destruction, is by
  destroying the natural habitat of various species. By cutting down or
  burning the forests, prairies, or scrub, and by bringing the land under
  cultivation, man indirectly kills off a species through starvation, from
  extermination of certain insects or plants on which it depends for food.
  Many species, such as the Moas, were evidently greatly reduced in numbers
  by cataclysms of Nature, such as volcanic outbreaks, earthquakes, floods,
  bush fires, etc., and then died out from what appears only explicable by
  the natural exhaustion of their vitality. The chief cause of the
  extermination of the Moas was undoubtedly their slaughter by the Maoris
  for food, but in several inaccessible parts of the interior large numbers
  of Moa remains have been found which undoubtedly had died for no apparent
  reason.</p>

  <p>This cause also seems to be the only explanation of the dying out of
  such birds as <i>Aechmorhynchus</i>, <i>Chaetoptila</i>,
  <i>Camptolaimus</i> and others.</p>

  <p>The melancholy fact however remains that man and his satellites, cats,
  rats, dogs, and pigs are the worst and in fact the only important agents
  of destruction of the native avifaunas wherever they go.</p>

  <p>I have not included in the body of this work the fossil species from
  the pleistocene of Europe, Asia, Australia and America, as I believe that
  these belonged to an avifauna of an epoch considerably anterior to those
  attributed to the pleistocene of New Zealand and the adjacent islands, as
  well as that of the Mascarenes and Madagascar. I, however, give here the
  list of the species described from the above mentioned regions which I
  have been able to find in our literature, to serve as a guide to those
  who may think I ought to have included them in the work itself.</p>

  British Museum. The original is preserved in the Museum at Sydney and was
  obtained from the pleistocene cavern-deposits in the Wellington Valley in
  New South Wales.</p>

  <p>A bird usually stated to be extinct is <i>Monarcha dimidiata</i>, from
  Rara-Tonga, but in March, 1901, two specimens, male and female, were
  procured by the Earl of Ranfurly. Doubtless this is a species which will
  one day vanish entirely, but at present it hardly comes within the scope
  of this work.</p>

  <p>The birds known to be more or less on the verge of extinction which I
  have not thought advisable to give in the main part of this book might,
  for convenience of reference and to avoid possible controversy as to my
  having omitted any species, be given here, but it must be understood that
  of these species I only know the fact that their numbers have been
  greatly reduced and mostly almost to vanishing point. I have already
  mentioned before that some of them may already have disappeared, but in
  many cases recent investigations are wanting, and all, therefore, that
  can be said of them is that they are threatened and may soon become
  extinct, if they still exist.</p>

  <p>Many of my readers will, I fear, find fault with me for having
  bestowed names on a number of forms, known only from fragments of bones,
  single bones, or two or three bones. Especially will they, I fear, blame
  me for doing this when these forms have been described by other authors
  who have refrained from giving names. My reasons for doing so are very
  simple: in such cases as Dr. Parker's species which are fully described,
  but quoted under the formula <i>Pachyornis species A</i> or
  <i>Anomalopteryx species B</i>, the danger lies in different authors
  using the same formula for quite other species. In the case of others,
  where an author fears to name a form, but gives the distinctive
  characters and quotes only <i>Casuarius species</i> or <i>Emeus sp.</i>,
  unless the author and page are quoted, confusion must arise, and so in
  both cases I have thought it easier for reference and also more concise
  to name all these forms which have been described or differentiated
  without a binomial or trinomial appellation. I have, however, refrained
  from doing so in the foregoing list of Pleistocene species in the <!--
  Page xiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiii"></a>{xiii}</span>following eight cases as I was not able
  to decide anything about them with the material or literature at my

<h5><span class="lg200">LITERATURE</span><br />
<span style="line-height:2em;">REFERRING TO</span><br />
<span style="font-size:300%;">EXTINCT BIRDS.</span></h5>

  <p>No attempt has been made to quote all books in which extinct birds
  have been mentioned; not only would that mean a tedious, long work, and a
  book in itself, but, the repetitions being so numerous, it would have
  been of very little use. On the other hand, I have tried to quote the
  most important literature referring to Extinct Birds, and I have
  specially been anxious to cite and verify the principal ancient
  literature. Well known general works on birds in which extinct species
  have, of course, also been mentioned, are, as a rule, not quoted; such
  as: The 27 volumes of the Catalogue of Birds; Brisson's Ornithology;
  Daubenton's, Buffon's and Montbeillard's works; Latham's Ornithological
  Writings; Linnaeus' Systema Naturae in all its editions; Vieillot's
  writings; popular natural histories and school books; Brehm's Thierleben
  in its various editions; Finsch's Papageien; Gray's and Sharpe's
  Hand-lists; Dubois' Synopsis Avium, lists of specimens in Museums, and
  many others, in which extinct birds are as a matter of course
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>Three most complete detailed bibliographies must be named: The
  "Bibliography of the Didinae," forming Appendix B. of Strickland's "Dodo
  and its Kindred" (1848), the Bibliography of <i>Alca impennis</i> by
  Wilhelm Blasius in the new Edition of Naumann, vol. XII, pp. 169-176
  (1903), and the Bibliography referring to the Moas by Hamilton, in the
  Trans. New Zealand Institute XXVI and XXVII (1894, 1895).</p>

  <p>Most of the books and pamphlets quoted hereafter are in my library at
  the Zoological Museum at Tring, in the ornithological part of which Dr.
  Hartert and I have been specially interested for many years. Those books
  that are not in my library are marked with an asterisk, but several of
  these I have been able to consult in other libraries.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">A</span>s</span> long ago as 1674 a
  note about the "Huppe" exists, by "Le Sieur D.B.," <i>i.e.</i>, Dubois.
  He says, when describing the birds of Réunion (translated): "Hoopoes or
  'Callendres,' having a white tuft on the head, the rest of the plumage
  white and grey, the bill and the feet like a bird of prey; they are a
  little larger than the young pigeons; this is another good game
  (<i>i.e.</i>, to eat) when it is fat."</p>

  <p>This description has generally been accepted as referring to the
  <i>Fregilupus</i>, though that of the bill and feet is then due to an
  error of the author, for <i>Fregilupus</i> has the bill and feet of a
  member of the <i>Sturnidae</i> or family of Starlings.</p>

  <p>Good descriptions and representations of the "Huppe" have been given
  in many places (see literature), but whether they were taken from males
  or females is generally not known. The sexes seem to be alike in colour,
  but the female is smaller, and has a shorter and straighter bill than the
  male. At least, this is the conclusion of Dr. Hartert, who saw the four
  examples in the museum at Troyes. As far as he could see through the
  glass all four <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>seemed to be adult birds, but two were larger
  with longer and more curved bills, two smaller and with shorter and
  straighter beaks, so that they are evidently two pairs.</p>

  <p>This bird seems to have become extirpated about the middle of the last
  century. The late Monsieur Pollen wrote in 1868 (translated): "This
  species has become so rare that one did not hear them mentioned for a
  dozen years. It has been destroyed in all the littoral districts, and
  even in the mountains near the coast. Trustworthy persons, however, have
  assured us that they must still exist in the forests of the interior,
  near St. Joseph. The old creoles told me that, in their youth, these
  birds were still common, and that they were so stupid that one could kill
  them with sticks. They call this bird the "Hoopoe." It is, therefore, not
  wrong what a distinguished inhabitant of Réunion, Mr. A. Legras, wrote
  about this bird with the following words: "The Hoopoe has become so rare
  that we have hardly seen a dozen in our wanderings to discover birds; we
  were even grieved to search for it in vain in our museum."</p>

  <p>We are certain that <i>Fregilupus</i> existed still on Réunion in
  1835, as Monsieur Desjardins, living on Mauritius, wrote in a manuscript
  formerly belonging to the late Professor Milne-Edwards: "My friend,
  Marcelin Sauzier, has sent me four alive from Bourbon in May, 1835. They
  eat everything. Two have escaped some months afterwards, and it might
  well happen that they will stock our forests."</p>

  <p>It seems, indeed, that specimens were killed in 1837 on Mauritius,
  where they did not originally exist. Verreaux shot an example in Réunion
  in 1832.</p>

  <p>The names "La Huppe du Cap" and "<i>Upupa madagascariensis</i>" arose
  out of the mistaken notions that this bird lived in South Africa or
  Madagascar, but we know now that its real home was Réunion or
  Bourbon.</p>

  <p>I should have been inclined to consider this bird an albinistic
  specimen of the bird described in "Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue," but for
  the fact that the tibia of <i>Necropsar rodericanus</i> is 52-59 mm. in
  length, while this is only 46 mm. in length, while the metatarsus
  measures 31.5 mm. as opposed to 36-41 mm. in <i>N. rodericanus</i>. I
  cannot accept the theory that this is the Islet au Mât bird, and
  therefore different from <i>N. rodericanus</i>, as the islet is too close
  to Rodriguez to have had a different starling. I therefore believe this
  bird to have been an albinistic specimen of the Mauritius species of
  <i>Necropsar</i>, for there can be little doubt that it is albinistic, as
  the ferruginous colour is much stronger on one wing than on the other;
  and I conclude that the colour in the wings and tail in normal specimens
  was black like the Rodriguez bird, and that <i>N. leguati</i> was a close
  ally of <i>N. rodericanus</i>, from which it differed principally in its
  much smaller size.</p>

  <p>Habitat doubtful.&mdash;The type specimen bears Lord Derby's Museum
  number, 1792, and a label of Verreaux giving Madagascar as the habitat,
  which is certainly erroneous.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">W</span>e</span> know absolutely
  nothing about this bird, except Daubenton's figure and the description by
  Montbeillard. In the plate the whole body, including the back, is uniform
  red, about the same red as in other species of <i>Foudia</i>, while the
  wings and tail are dark brown with yellowish-brown borders. In the
  description the body plumage is described as rufous ("morderé") and the
  wings, wing-coverts and tail as more or less bright rufous ("d'un mordoré
  plus ou moins clair"). The size is said to be about that of a Bunting,
  but the tail shorter and the wings longer.</p>

  <p>According to Dr. Sharpe (Cat. B. XIII, p. 484) "it has generally been
  considered identical with <i>Foudia madagascariensis</i>," but the latter
  has the back marked with longitudinal black spots, while both the figure
  and description of <i>F. bruante</i> represent a uniform red upperside;
  moreover the locality of the latter is expressly stated, and as we know
  other forms of <i>Foudia</i> from the Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros,
  Aldabra and Madagascar, we have no reason to doubt the statement. We are
  not aware of any specimen existing of this doubtless extinct bird, though
  it would be worth while to search the Paris Museum for this treasure.</p>

  the brilliantly coloured adult male might be the young, the female the
  adult bird, "as is the case in the Pine-Grosbeak" (<i>Sic!</i>).</p>

  <p>Kittlitz, who visited the largest of the Bonin Islands in May, 1828,
  obtained a number of specimens, of which some are in St. Petersburg, two
  in Frankfurt-a.-M., one or two in Leyden, and, I believe, in Paris. <!--
  Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>These
  seem to be all the specimens known in European museums. Mr. Seebohm's
  collector, the late Holst, failed to obtain it, and Mr. Alan Owston's
  men, who several times went to the Bonin group to obtain it, and who were
  promised good prices for specimens, did not get one. I am therefore
  convinced that for some unknown reason this bird became extinct, though
  there is still the possibility that the recent collectors did not collect
  on the main island of the group, which alone was visited by Kittlitz.</p>

  <p>Kittlitz tells us that he found it in the woods along the coast, but
  not numerous. That it keeps concealed, is very phlegmatic, and is so
  little shy that one is obliged to go back for some distance, before
  shooting, if one wishes to preserve the specimen. Kittlitz saw it but
  seldom on high trees, mostly on the ground. Its frequently heard note is
  a very fine piping sound. In the crop and stomach small fruit and buds of
  one kind of tree were found.</p>

  <p>Habitat: The largest of the Bonin Islands, south of Japan.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">A</span>s</span> explained in Nov.
  Zool. 1899, p. 154, it is uncertain where Darwin obtained the type
  specimens of Gould's <i>G. magnirostris</i>, as "Unfortunately, most of
  the specimens of the finch-tribe were mingled together," as Darwin tells
  us in his "Journal of Researches" (New Edition 1890, p. 420), and he had
  only "strong reasons to suspect that some of the species of the sub-group
  <i>Geospiza</i> are confined to separate islands." We are, however,
  convinced that the types of <i>G. magnirostris</i> can only have come
  from Charles Island, where it is, probably, the representative of <i>G.
  strenua strenua</i>. It seems, however, that <i>G. magnirostris</i>
  exists no longer, for all subsequent collectors have failed to obtain
  specimens, unless an immature specimen in the U. S. Nat. Mus., from
  Charles Island (No. 115,905), is a young <i>magnirostris</i> (cf. Nov.
  Zool. 1902, p. 388).</p>

  <p>The dimensions of the three black specimens in the British Museum are
  as follows: Culmen 26.5, 27, 27; height of bill at base 23.5-24; wing 91,
  91, 95; tarsus 25 mm. These measurements&mdash;a culmen of over 26.5 and
  a wing of 91 mm. combined&mdash;do not occur among our large series of
  <i>strenua</i>, and therefore it is hardly possible that <i>G.
  magnirostris</i> is composed of huge examples of <i>strenua</i> only.</p>

  <p>As Charles Island has been inhabited for many years it is not at all
  unlikely that a bird became extinct on that place. On plate <a
  href="#plate3">3</a> is figured <i>G. magnirostris</i> and a head of
  <i>G. strenua</i> for comparison. <!-- Page 12 --><span

  differ from each other, there is some reason to suspect that they are

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> late Sir Walter
  Buller described, in 1873, <i>Miro traversi</i> as follows: "Adult male.
  The whole of the plumage black, the base of the feathers dark plumbeous;
  wing-feathers and their coverts tinged with brown, the former greyish on
  their inner surface; tail-feathers black, very slightly tinged with
  brown. Irides dark brown; bill black; tarsi and toes blackish brown, the
  soles of the feet dull yellow. Total length 6 inches; wing, from flexure,
  3.4; tail 2.6; bill 0.5, tarsus 1.1; middle toe and claw 0.1, hind toe
  and claw 0.8 inch."</p>

  <p>"Female. Slightly smaller than the male, and without the brown tinge
  on the wings and tail."</p>

  <p>It may be added that <i>Miro traversi</i> is not pure black, but of a
  somewhat brownish slaty black.</p>

  <p><i>Miro traversi</i> is only known from the Chatham Islands, where it
  was formerly very common, but, according to a letter from the late W.
  Hawkins, the cats, which have been introduced to destroy rats and
  rabbits, have exterminated it. It seems to have disappeared from
  Warekauri, the main island of the Chatham group, long ago, for H. O.
  Forbes (Ibis 1893, p. 524) and Henry Palmer found it, in 1890 and 1892,
  only on the outlying islets of Mangare and Little Mangare.</p>

  <p>The bird from the Snares is quite different, being deep glossy black
  and having a shorter and narrower first primary. I named it <i>M.
  dannefaerdi</i>. It is to be feared that a similar fate will one day
  befall it as has, apparently, already befallen its congener from the
  Chatham Islands.</p>

  <p>Sir Walter Buller (Suppl. B.N.Z. II, p. 125) has confounded <i>M.
  traversi</i> and <i>dannefaerdi</i>, and the figure he gave on his plate
  looks so black, that I do not doubt it represents rather the latter than
  the former. Of course <i>M. dannefaerdi</i> alone occurs on the Snares,
  and Buller's <i>traversi</i> from the Snares were all dannefaerdi. Dr.
  Finsch's statement (Ibis 1888, p. 308) that Reischek's specimen from the
  Snares "agreed in every respect with specimens from the Chatham Islands"
  is entirely wrong, for, even if <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>one prefers unscientifically to lump allied
  forms, one cannot say that a <i>Miro</i> from the Chathams agrees in
  every respect with one from the Snares. Buller's doubts about the
  distinctness of the latter might easily have been removed, if he had
  taken the trouble to compare them, for it does not require any genius to
  see the differences. I admit that with my present views on geographical
  forms I would regard the two <i>Miro</i> as sub-species, and call them
  <i>M. traversi traversi</i> and <i>M. traversi dannefaerdi</i>, but most
  ornithologists would still consider them to be "good species."</p>

  <p>I may add that Buller, l.c., p. 125, has not quoted my description
  correctly, for in his rendering are several disturbing misprints, and in
  the fourth line from the bottom occurs a "not" which ought not to be
  there, and which makes the sentence incomprehensible. Also the name
  itself is spelt incorrectly.</p>

  <p>I have a series from Mangare and Little Mangare, taken by Henry Palmer
  in 1890. The egg seems to be unknown.</p>

  <p>The only person who ever collected this short-tailed Ground-Thrush was
  Kittlitz, who obtained four specimens, one of which is in St. Petersburg,
  one in Frankfurt, one in Vienna, and one in Leyden. Neither Holst, nor
  Alan Owston's Japanese collectors obtained specimens, though their
  special attention was called to it. Therefore, unless these recent
  collectors left unvisited the most important island of the group, we must
  suppose that it became extinct.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">I</span>n</span> 1894 I described
  this remarkable little bird as follows: "<i>Traversia</i>, gen. nov.
  <i>Xenicidarum</i>. Differs in several important points both from
  <i>Xenicus</i> and <i>Acanthidositta</i>. Bill much larger and stouter,
  very little shorter, if at all, than the tarsus; the latter about as long
  as middle toe without claw, or the hind toe and claw, while in
  <i>Xenicus</i> and <i>Acanthidositta</i> it is about twice as long as the
  hind toe. The principal difference, however, is the weakness of the wing,
  which suggests flightlessness, as does also the very soft and loose
  character of the entire plumage, and the very Ralline aspect of the bird.
  There are only ten tail-feathers, and the scutellation of the tarsus is
  like that of <i>Xenicus</i>. These two points determine its position in
  the <i>Xenicidae</i> at once (cf. Sclater, Cat. B. XIV, p. 450).</p>

  <p>"The type is: <i>Traversia lyalli</i>, sp. nov.</p>

  <p>"Male. Above dark brownish olive-yellow, each feather with a
  brownish-black border. A narrow distinct yellow superciliary line. Wings
  and tail umber-brown, the inner webs darker; wing-coverts like back.
  Chin, throat, and breast chrome-yellow, each feather slightly edged with
  greyish brown. Flanks, abdomen, and vent pale brown, centre of feathers
  paler.</p>

  <p>"Female. Upper surface umber-brown, each feather bordered with very
  dark brown; wings and tail similar. Under surface buffy grey, the
  feathers edged with pale brown. Total length about 4 inches, culmen 0.6,
  wing 1.8 to 1.9, tail 0.8, but much concealed, tarens 0.75, middle toe
  0.65, hind toe without claw 0.5. <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>"Habitat: Stephens Island, New Zealand. Discovered by Mr. Dr. Lyall,
  lighthouse-keeper, and sent to me by Mr. Henry H. Travers."</p>

  <p>I received nine specimens of this new bird, and was not aware that any
  others had been taken at that time. As I was unable to attend the
  December meeting, 1894, of the British Ornithologists Club, I asked Dr.
  Hartert to exhibit the birds in my name. When he had done so and had read
  the description, the Chairman, Dr. P. L. Sclater, said that the bird had
  also been received for illustration and description in the Ibis, from Sir
  Walter Buller, and he asked Dr. Hartert if I would not withdraw my
  description. Dr. Hartert said that this was unfortunate, but he had no
  authority to withdraw my description, and he and Dr. Sharpe thought that
  the proceedings of the meeting should be printed without consideration of
  any manuscripts which might refer to the same bird. No doubt this was
  hard luck on Sir Walter Buller, but it would have been equally hard luck
  for me if he had forestalled me with the new bird. He had only one
  specimen, I had nine, of both sexes, and I had paid a high price for
  them, as types of a new bird. My type is in Tring, and, as everybody
  knows, available for study by any competent ornithologist, while Buller's
  type was not in any museum, and it was uncertain to whom he would sell it
  afterwards. I suppose it is now in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, to
  which Buller's third collection, 625 specimens, was sold for a thousand
  pounds, as Buller himself tells us in his Supplement II, p. 167, under
  the heading of <i>Glaucopis wilsoni</i>! On the same page Sir Walter
  Buller also tells us that his "second collection" was sold to me, but he
  makes a mistake about the price, as I certainly did not pay a thousand
  pounds for it.</p>

  <p>I mentioned these unimportant details, because Buller rather bitterly
  and severely complained about my describing the Stephens' Island Wren, on
  p. 111 of his supplement. I may only add that of course my name, being
  published in December, 1894, has the priority over his, which was not
  published before April, 1895.</p>

  <p>The history of <i>Traversia lyalli</i> is perhaps the most
  extraordinary of any bird known. All the specimens I am aware of, viz.,
  the eight now in my collection, the type of "<i>Xenicus insularis</i>" in
  Buller's former collection, one in the late Canon Tristram's collection,
  one in the British Museum (ex Tring), and two or more offered some years
  ago by Mr. Travers, were brought in by the lighthouse-keeper's cat.
  Evidently this feline discoverer has at the same time been the
  exterminator of <i>Traversia lyalli</i>, and many may have been digested
  by that unique cat, as in letters received from Mr. Travers I <!-- Page
  25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>have been
  told that no more specimens could be obtained, and Buller (l.c.) says:
  "Very diligent search has been made on Stephen Island for further
  specimens of the Island Wren, but without success, and there is too much
  reason to fear that this species has almost immediately after its
  discovery become extinct."</p>

  <p>Habitat: Stephen Island, a small, partly wooded islet, about a square
  mile in extent, in Cook Strait. It is almost impossible that this bird
  has only existed on Stephen Island. It must have been overlooked on
  d'Urville Island or the "mainland," where it probably became
  extinct&mdash;through rats and cats, and similar pests&mdash;long
  ago.</p>

  family of <i>Meliphagidae</i> or Honey-eaters, and the genus is
  sufficiently distinct from all others. There are no fleshy wattles
  anywhere. The tail is long and strongly graduated; all the rectrices are
  obliquely pointed at their tips. The plumage of the body is very soft,
  that of the head, throat and chest almost fluffy; the feathers of the
  chin, throat and forehead end in hair-like bristles.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">B</span>oth</span> Mr. Scott Wilson
  and myself have at length discussed this beautiful bird in our books on
  the Hawaiian Avifauna. Of the actual status of this bird in former times
  we know nothing. Latham described it first (Gmelin named this species
  after Latham's description) from a pair in the Leverian collection, which
  is now preserved in the Vienna Museum. About half a century ago several
  specimens were collected by the late W. Mills near Hilo, on the island of
  Hawaii, the only island where it existed. Nothing certain was heard of
  the "Mamo" until, in 1892, my collector Henry Palmer obtained a fine
  male, which was caught before his eyes by a native birdcatcher. In July,
  1898, Mr. H. W. Henshaw saw "at least a pair, possibly a whole family,"
  in the woods of Kaumana, and in 1899 a native heard the, to him,
  well-known call near the same place. This brings the existence of the
  Mamo down to the year 1898 or 1899. In view of the futile efforts of
  Messrs. Henry Palmer, <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>Perkins, Henshaw and others to observe this
  rare bird again, we may well suppose that this species is either extinct,
  or will very soon vanish if any are left.</p>

  <p>In former times the Mamo was probably more or less common. Its golden
  yellow feathers were of great value, and, though the majority of the
  famous war-cloaks are composed of the feathers of <i>Moho nobilis</i>, a
  few such cloaks are known to consist of Mamo feathers. It is supposed
  that it took generations to complete such a cape.</p>

  <p>I only know of specimens of this bird in Vienna, Leyden, Paris,
  Honolulu, Cambridge and Tring.</p>

  <p>The two examples in the Vienna Museum were obtained by Fichtel at the
  sale of the Leverian collection. One is perfect, the other has the upper
  portion of the bill wanting.</p>

  under the name of <i>Hemignathus obscurus</i>. It is true that
  Lichtenstein says, that Herr Deppe procured several specimens, but there
  is only one in the Berlin Museum, and we have no knowledge where the
  others may be, if they are still in existence.</p>

  <p>There can hardly be any doubt that <i>H. obscurus ellisianus</i> is
  extinct on Oahu, where it was discovered by Deppe. All recent collectors,

  <p>"Above greenish olive-brown, more greenish on the back and rump, and
  somewhat more greyish on the head and hind-neck; the dark bases of the

  superciliary stripe. Chin, throat, and middle of abdomen dull brownish
  white (apparently somewhat faded). Upper breast olive-greenish, sides of
  breast and flanks dull olive-greenish, more olive-brown on the flanks.
  Wings and tail deep brown, bordered with yellowish green. Under-wing
  coverts dull white. Bill brown, somewhat horn-brown, but not blackish, as
  in the other forms of <i>Hemignathus</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not probable that the bill and feet are faded, as in specimens
  of <i>Heterorhynchus lucidus</i> collected and stuffed at the same time
  and kept side by side with <i>H. o. ellisianus</i>, the bill and feet are
  still blackish and not brown.</p>

  <p>It has long been a question whether <i>Nestor productus</i> of Gould

  Island, could have a different species of <i>Nestor</i> to that found on
  the larger island. Since commencing to write this book, however, I have
  come to somewhat different conclusions. In the first place no special
  locality is given for <i>N. productus</i> by the earlier authors, in the
  same way as in the case of <i>Notornis alba</i>, which, like the
  <i>Nestor</i>, was said to come from N. S. Wales. This fact is easily
  explained, as N. S. Wales and Norfolk Island were both penal settlements
  in the early days, and there was intercourse by regular vessels plying
  between these colonies and Lord Howe's Island. Now we find in the case of
  several other birds that distinct local forms occur on Norfolk and Lord
  Howe's Islands, while as far as I know there is no other record of a
  distinct bird from Philip Island. I therefore believe that <i>Nestor
  productus</i> inhabited both Norfolk and Philip Islands, and that all
  specimens extant are from Philip Island, where it lingered some years
  longer than on the main island, while the specimens of Ferdinand Bauer
  and Governor Hunter, and possibly the supposed <i>N. norfolcensis</i> of
  <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>Canon Tristram's collection, now in
  Liverpool, had been brought from Lord Howe's Island in cages and were
  kept as pets in Norfolk Island; and then, as the value of exact data in
  those early days of our science was unknown, the references were made to
  the place whence the specimens were seen or brought. One thing however is
  certain, the bill in Ferdinand Bauer's sketch is evidently a monstrous
  growth produced by captivity, for Latham expressly describes the bill of
  Governor Hunter's bird as ending in a long thin point. The differences of
  <i>N. norfolcensis</i> are the dull crimson sides of face, chin, and
  throat; dull green head and hind neck, and the total absence of bars on
  the tail. The plate given herewith is a reproduction of the Liverpool
  bird, with the bill of Ferdinand Bauer's sketch added, as this is wanting
  in that bird, and in the corner a head of the specimen of <i>N.
  productus</i>, purchased for the Tring Museum, when the late Mr.
  Wallace's Museum at Distington, Cumberland, was dispersed.</p>

  <p>I have carefully examined the three fine specimens of <i>Nestor
  productus</i> in the British Museum, and the conclusion I have come to is
  that the bird described by Gould as the adult of his <i>N. productus</i>
  was an abnormal specimen, and was in relation to normal <i>N.
  productus</i> what the aberrations called "<i>superbus</i>" and
  "<i>esslingi</i>" are to <i>N. meridionalis</i>. The bills of the British
  Museum specimens are very different. The one from the Bell collection has
  the long, thin bill, but it is at least half-an-inch to three-quarters
  shorter than those in the Tring and Florence specimens.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Philip Island and probably Norfolk Island.</p>

  <p>One in Tring, three in London, one in Florence, two in Vienna, one in
  Prague, two in Leyden, one in Amsterdam, are known to me.</p>

  <p>The two specimens in the Vienna Museum were both bought in 1839. One
  from Ward, with a short bill, brown chest and throat, and a very wide
  yellow breast-band. The other from Baron von Hügel, which has a long bill
  and very red cheeks and chin. <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  items of natural history there is a sketch of <i>Lophopsittacus</i> from

  description, taken from Levaillant, is (translated) as follows: "This
  <i>Aras</i>, which others have held to be only a variety of <i>Macao</i>,
  is according to Vaillant a distinct species. It is one third smaller than
  the red-fronted species, or 1 ft. 10 in. long, of which the tail takes 11
  inches and the bill 18 lines. The latter is of a black colour and has the
  upper mandible less curved, and the sides of the lower mandible more
  swollen than is the case in the other <i>Ara</i> species. The cheeks are
  naked and white, with three lines of red feathers. Head, front and sides
  of the neck, breast, belly and thighs red; back of the neck pale yellow;
  back, shoulders and smaller wing coverts brownish red bordered with
  yellow or green; flanks yellowish, primaries above dark azure blue, below
  coppery red. Crissum violet blue, undertail coverts pale blue with green
  and brown-red borders; under-wing coverts red, the larger yellow, and
  brownish green. Two centre tail feathers all red with blue tips, the
  outer ones blue on outer webs and tips, red on the rest of the
  feather."</p>

  <p>Of this bird I know only of two in the British Museum, one in Paris,
  one in Leyden, one in Liverpool. The specimen in the Paris Museum bears
  the inscription "Macrocercus tricolor (Bechst.) M. E. Rosseau. Cuba.
  Ménagerie 1842." Probably, however, there are more specimens in other
  museums.</p>

  <p>Apparently the last specimen was shot in 1864 at La Vega (Bangs,
  Americ. Nat. XXXIX, p. 200).</p>

  <p>Like all the extinct West Indian Macaws, Amazons and Conures, it
  became extinct through its persecution by the inhabitants for food.</p>

  considerably larger than a pigeon, with a <i>very</i> long tail and a
  <i>very</i> large head and bill. Unfortunately the writer does not
  mention the colour, but adds that the smaller green and blue parrot
  (<i>Palaeornis exsul</i>) was much handsomer; so we can safely assume
  that our bird was of sombre colouration. It was undoubtedly closely
  allied to the genus <i>Palaeornis</i>. The two following, though much
  brighter coloured and but scantily described, apparently belong to the
  same genus.</p>

  with the Vazas and the Grey Parrot (<i>Psittacus erithacus</i>), in the

  1879, and Salvadori (Cat. B. XX, p. 421, 1891)&mdash;have admitted a
  separate genus, <i>Mascarinus</i>. This is evidently the proper course,
  and I agree with W. A. Forbes, Oustalet and Salvadori that its nearest
  affinities appear to be the genus <i>Tanygnathus</i> rather than
  <i>Coracopsis</i>, and that the place of <i>Mascarinus</i> is among the
  <i>Palaeornithinae</i> of Salvadori.</p>

  <p>The large red bill, with distinctly ridged gonys, concealed nostrils
  and moderately long, strongly rounded tail, are peculiar characters. The

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">I</span>t</span> has been mentioned
  above that "Le Sieur D.B." (Dubois) described this Parrot clearly in
  1674, and that it lived on Réunion, and not on Madagascar. Linnaeus in
  1771 (see above) was the first to bestow a scientific name on it, though
  Brisson had already again described it in 1760. Linnaeus' diagnosis is,
  as usual, rather poor, and not quite correct<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, but his reference to Brisson leaves no
  doubt as to what he meant.</p>

  <p>This parrot is one of the rarest of extinct birds, only two stuffed
  specimens being known. One normally coloured specimen is preserved in the
  Museum of Natural History in Paris, and it is evidently this which has
  been figured by Daubenton and Levaillant, and in the "Centenaire du
  Muséum d'Historie Naturelle." From the latter plate my figure has been
  taken.</p>

  <p>The example in Vienna is unfortunately semi-albinistic, there being
  some white feathers on the back, wings and tail. Another normal
  individual, however, lived formerly in the Menagerie of the King of
  Bavaria, where it was depicted by Hahn in 1835. Unfortunately this
  specimen has not been preserved.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>here</span> has been
  considerable confusion with regard to this parrot. It was first asserted
  that it occurred on both Bourbon and Mauritius. Then Professor Newton
  separated the Mauritius bird as <i>Pal. echo</i>. Salvadori, however, in
  Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. XX, p. 442, reunited the Bourbon and Mauritius
  birds, while quite unaccountably stating only Mauritius as the
  habitat.</p>

  <p>The Abbé Dubois describes this bird as follows: "Green Parrots as
  large as pigeons having a black collar."</p>

  <p>Now the species of <i>Palaeornis</i> from Rodriguez, the Seychelles,
  and the mainland of Africa are all distinct, and the other land birds of
  Mauritius are and were different from those of Bourbon. I therefore feel

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>his</span> owl, I believe,
  is not a true <i>Scops</i>, being much too big, but we must leave it in
  that genus for the present, as there are no specimens or bones extant,
  and only Jossigny's drawing to guide us as to its appearance. The first
  mention of owls on Mauritius was in the year 1606, when Admiral Matlief
  says that owls were common in the Island. Monsieur Desjardins, in 1837,
  gave the first accurate description of the bird, of which I here
  reproduce the translation. "The digits and even the tarsi are not
  feathered, only on the front portion of these latter one sees some short,
  stiff feathers running down to a point nearly to the centre. The digits
  are very strong, they being armed with hooked nails.</p>

  <p>The beak is very stout, arched from its base; the upper mandible,
  which is much longer than the other and covering it, is as if cut square
  at the point. The nostrils pierce the bill pretty high up in the horny
  portion. The eyes, of which I could not see the colour, are round, and
  placed, like in the entire family, in front. They are surrounded by a
  circle or disc of stiff, thread-like feathers, which is interrupted at
  the sides. A sort of collar is perceptible on the throat. Two tufts,
  similar to those of the Eagle Owls and Eared Owls, and very apparent, are
  behind the eyes and towards the top of the occiput.</p>

  <p>The wings are a little longer than the tail, the fourth and fifth
  primaries being the longest, the third and sixth are shorter, and the
  second still shorter, being equal to the eighth, and the first is
  shortest of all. The tail reaches to the end of the digits; it is rounded
  and not much lengthened: all the retrices are equal in length. The
  ear-tufts are brown, with some slight buff shading, the discal plumes
  being white marked with buff. All the upper side is of a dark brown
  colour, the feathers of the head, the neck and the back are edged with
  rufous, but not very distinctly so; this rufous colour is more apparent
  on the scapulars, and some of these even have on the outer web one or two
  whitish patches surrounded with brown.</p>

  <p>The large tail feathers are less brown and more rufous in colour, with
  lighter rufous marbling mixed with brown.</p>

  <p>The tertials and secondaries have a darker brown bar towards the
  centre, and their outer web is pleasantly marked with somewhat square
  ocelli or irregular bands of white, pale buff, and brown. The large
  primaries or <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>flight feathers present the same
  ornamentation, but more strongly developed, and the blotches are buffy
  white on the inner web, which produces a regular spotting on a brown
  ground colour; the tip of these large feathers is finely stippled with
  brown on a fairly pale ground; and there is a large patch of white on the
  wings in addition.</p>

  <p>The throat and abdomen are nicely adorned with dark buff feathers,
  which have a black brown centre and two to four large round white spots.
  The large feathers on the flanks are whitish, with a brown shaft line and
  marked with buff. All the well feathered parts, underneath the feathers
  are covered by a very thick black down."</p>

  <p>The colour of bill and feet is reddish brown. Total length, 13½ inches
  = 345 mm. Desjardins says the specimen he described was killed at the end
  of October, 1836, in the forest crowning the hills close to "Bamboo
  Creek." In 1837 several were still seen near "La Savane," and one was
  killed at Curepipe by Dr. Dobson of the 99th Regiment. This latter is
  believed to have been one of, if not the last of this species, so we have
  to thank that excellent naturalist, Desjardins, and Monsieur Jossigny,
  the companion of Commerson, that we know what this extinct species was
  like.</p>

  blackish brown; entire upper surface strongly suffused with rufous;
  quills marked with regular transverse bars and a terminal edging of

  with pale brown; bill lemon-yellow; feet dull yellow."</p>

  <p>"Wairarapa district, near Wellington, North Island, in the summer
  1868-9."</p>

  <p>This supposed "species" is a very doubtful one. A close examination in
  the Tring Museum of the type (which was offered me for such a high price
  that I did not feel justified in buying it, fond as I am of possessing
  extinct forms, types and varieties) by Messrs. Hartert, Hellmayr and
  myself proved beyond doubt to all three of us that the specimen was not
  fully adult, but showed signs of immaturity. If I said to Sir Walter
  Buller that it was an extremely young, hardly fledged <i>Sceloglaux</i>
  this was certainly incorrect, and was perhaps just an exclamation after a
  hasty preliminary examination, for the bird is of course fully fledged
  and has passed, at least partially, through one moult of the feathers. On
  the other hand, both Professor Newton's and Dr. Sharpe's reputed
  statements that the owl in question is fully adult are not correct. It
  certainly shows unmistakable signs of immaturity, as noticed at once by
  Dr. Gadow (cf. Newton's letter on p. 66, l.c.), by Hartert, Hellmayr and
  myself. Moreover Professor Newton&mdash;though Buller says he "pronounced
  it to be an adult bird"&mdash;also admits that the bird "had moulted,
  though not necessarily to be in adult plumage," and he continues that he
  thinks the character of the markings continues to be juvenile.</p>

  <p>Having thus discussed the age of this owl, the question must be
  considered if it is different from <i>S. albifacies</i> from the South
  Island. This is less easily done. Buller described it as a "new species,"
  and mentions among the distinctive characters (see above) the colour of
  the tail. The tail, however, is "skillfully" (as Buller calls it, though
  I should use a less complimentary adverb) stuck in, and does not belong
  to a <i>Sceloglaux</i>, but to an Australian <i>Ninox</i>, and also some
  feathers on the neck are foreign. The wings being abraded, its slightly
  smaller length is not very significant. Certainly, however, the
  colouration in general is slightly more rufous than <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>in <i>S. albifacies</i>,
  though some of my specimens approach it almost completely, and the face
  is more rufescent. Professor Newton cautiously warned Sir Walter Buller,
  suggesting that <i>S. albifacies</i> might possibly have a red "phase,"
  like <i>Syrnium aluco</i>, and this North Island specimen represented the
  latter. As for myself, I do not think that <i>S. albifacies</i> has two
  phases, as I have seen too many specimens, and found them to vary but
  little. I have now in my collection eight specimens from the South
  Island. On the other hand, I have not seen juvenile examples; but it is
  very likely that the rufous face of the North Island specimen is a
  character peculiar to the North Island form, which would then be a
  sub-species of <i>S. albifacies</i> from the South Island, and should be
  called <i>S. albifacies rufifacies</i>. The type from Wairapara is said
  to have been killed in the summer of 1868-9, and, since no further
  evidence of its existence has come forth, I presume that the North Island
  race of this owl must be extinct by this time.</p>

  Gadow</span> give the measurements of, and describe a pair of metatarsi
  procured with the remains described as <i>Strix sauzieri</i>, and state
  that they do not fit in with that species. For, as they are fully adult
  bones, it is impossible to attribute their much smaller size to youth.
  They then add a sentence of which this is the first part: "Unless we
  assume, what is unlikely, that the Island of Mauritius possessed two
  different species of <i>Strix</i>, we have to conclude that the short
  pair of metatarsals belonged to a small individual of <i>Strix
  sauzieri</i>, &mdash;&mdash;." Evidently Messrs. Gadow and Newton, when
  they wrote this, did not remember the fact that throughout a very large
  portion of the range of <i>Strix flammea</i>, its various geographical
  races are found side by side with another species of the group of
  <i>Strix</i>, namely, <i>S. candida</i> and <i>S. capensis</i>, popularly
  called "<i>Grass owls</i>"; these in nearly every case have the legs
  considerably longer than in the true <i>Barn Owls</i> (<i>Strix
  flammea</i> and its races).</p>

  <p>Therefore I consider it not in the least unlikely that two species of
  <i>Strix</i> inhabited Mauritius, and that <i>Strix sauzieri</i> was the
  Mauritian representative of the "Grass Owls," while these two short
  metatarsals belonged to the representative of the "Barn Owls." I
  therefore have much pleasure in naming this form after the collector of
  these bones, the late Sir Edward Newton.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">P</span>allas</span> gives the first
  recognizable description of this bird, which, as translated from the
  Latin, is as follows: "Of the size of a very large goose. Of the shape of
  the former (sc. Cormorants), which it also resembles in the white patches
  on the flanks. The body is entirely black. A few long, white, narrow
  pendant plumes round the neck, as in Herons. Occiput with a huge tuft,
  doubly crested. Skin round the base of the bill bare, red, blue and
  white, mixed, as in a turkey. Round the eyes a thick, bare white patch of
  skin, about six lines wide, like a pair of spectacles. Weight 12 to 14
  pounds. Female smaller, without crest and spectacles. (From
  Steller.)"</p>

  <p>Steller, who was shipwrecked on Bering Island in 1741, was the
  discoverer of <i>C. perspicillatus</i>, and Pallas took his diagnosis
  from Steller's notes.</p>

  <p>The Spectacled or Pallas's Cormorant is one of the rarest of all
  birds. It is generally said that four specimens are known, but five are
  really in existence: Two in the St. Petersburg Museum, one in Leyden, and
  two in London. One of these latter is perfect, while the other has no
  tail. Probably all five have been obtained by Kuprianoff, the Russian
  Governor at Sitka, who, in 1839, gave one to Captain Belcher, and sent
  some others to St. Petersburg. The careful researches of Stejneger and
  others on Bering Island have clearly shown that this Cormorant exists no
  longer. Formerly it is said to have been numerous, but the natives were
  fond of its flesh, which formed their principal diet when other meat was
  difficult to obtain. Probably it would not so soon have become extinct if
  it had not been that their rather short wings resulted in a certain
  slowness of locomotion on land and in the air. A good description is
  given in the Catalogue of Birds, and a still more detailed one by
  Stejneger (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. 1899, p. 86) from Brandt's
  manuscript.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Mauritius.</p>

  <p>In an old work entitled "Memorandums concerning India" by J. Marshall
  (1668) in the article on the Island of Mauritius, there occurs this
  passage: "They are many Geese; the halfe of their wings towards the end
  are black and the other halfe white; they are not large, but fat and
  good. Plenty of Ducks." As there is no mention of the caruncle on the
  bill here or in other authors alluding to geese in Mauritius, Oustalet
  doubted that these geese were this <i>Sarcidiornis</i>, but I believe
  this merely to have been an oversight of Marshall's and that his
  description goes far to prove the distinctness of Newton and Gadow's
  species.</p>

  <p>The allusion to the small size also points to the geese of Marshall
  being the <i>Sarcidiornis</i>. L'Abbé Dubois in "Les Voyages du Sieur
  D.B." records the fact that on Bourbon were some wild geese slightly
  smaller than the geese of Europe but having the same plumage. Their bill
  and feet were red. It is also probable that wild geese were found on
  Rodriguez. There is nothing to show what these Bourbon geese were, and as
  no osseous remains of such birds have been found as yet it is impossible
  to do more than mention the fact of such birds having been recorded.</p>

  of pretty Pied Ducks, which whistled as they flew, or as they fed, seen
  by Mr. Lawson in the western branch of Cape Fear inlet, were of this
  kind."</p>

  <p>The Labrador-Duck is one of those birds, the disappearance of which is
  not easily explained. As Mr. Dutcher truly said, "we can speculate as to
  the cause of its disappearance, but we have no facts to warrant a
  conclusion." Formerly <i>Camptolaimus</i> was of regular occurrence along
  the northern Atlantic shores of North America, in winter south to New
  Jersey and New York. It has often been sold on the markets of New York
  and Baltimore, and nobody anticipated even fifty years ago that they
  might become extinct, but they <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>appear never to have been very numerous,
  at least we have no proof of this. It is true that Professor Newton tells
  us that this duck used to breed on rocky islets, and that "its fate is
  easily understood," since "man began yearly to visit its breeding haunts,
  and, not content in plundering its nests, mercilessly to shoot the
  birds." This, however, seems to be mere conjecture, as we do not know for
  certain where the breeding haunts of this Duck have been, and that anyone
  has ever visited them. All information known about the breeding of this
  bird is that of Audubon, who says that his son was shown empty nests on
  the top of bushes, which a clerk of the fishing establishment told him
  were those of the Labrador Duck. This information is certainly too
  uncertain to draw any conclusions from, but the breeding places might
  just as well have been much further to the north, and probably were.</p>

  <p>This makes a total of 48 known specimens. <!-- Page 107 --><span

  <p>The last specimens killed were those shot in May, 1871, at Grand Manan
  Island, the date of which is absolutely certain, and the specimen bought
  from a Mr. J. G. Bell in 1879, for the Smithsonian Institution, which is
  said to have been shot in 1875, but this date seems not quite certain
  (Cf. Auk, 1894, p. 9). That several other specimens were shot later than
  1852 is perfectly certain. As the specimen of 1875, or thereabouts, is a
  young male, Mr. Lawrence's question about the old birds is certainly
  justified. As, however, no Labrador Duck has been recorded later than
  1871 or 1875 we may suppose that it is now extinct.</p>

  <p>My young male was bought in the Fulton Market, New York, about 1860,
  and probably came from Long Island. It was mounted by John Bell, a
  bird-stuffer, through whose hands several Labrador Ducks have gone, and
  is in the finest possible condition. I bought this bird from the late
  Gordon Plummer, shortly before his death. He died at his home in
  Brookline, Mass., in November, 1893. (Cf. Auk, 1891, p. 206.)</p>

  <p>My adult male is the one of which the history is given in Auk, 1894,
  p. 176. It is described there in detail and then added: "Shot in the bay
  of Laprairie this spring (1862) by a habitant, and purchased by Mr.
  Thompson of this city, who has kindly placed it at my disposal for
  examination." Mr. William Dutcher of New York City bought this specimen
  from the widow of the Mr. Thompson, mentioned in the above note as the
  original owner, and I purchased it from Mr. William Dutcher, who informs
  me that "the Bay of Laprairie" is simply a name given to a wide part of
  the River St. Lawrence, just south of Montreal, Quebec. The name is found
  on good maps of Quebec.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">L</span>eguat's</span> description,
  here translated, is as <span class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"We had
  Bitterns as big and as fat as capons. They are tamer and more easily
  caught than the 'gelinotes.'" He also says, "The lizards often serve as
  prey for the birds, especially for the Bitterns. When we shook them down
  from the branches with a pole, these birds ran up and gobbled them down
  in front of us, in spite of all we could do to prevent them; and even if
  we only pretended to do so they came in the same manner and always
  followed us about."</p>

  <p>Milne-Edwards remarks, among other notes, that "This bird is not a
  true Bittern, but its head is so large and its feet so short that it is
  easy to understand that Leguat should have called it so."</p>

  <p>The bony structure of the head is remarkable on account of its massive
  and thick proportions; the skull itself is strongly enlarged posteriorly,
  and the temporal fossae are bordered by very pronounced ridges,
  especially those on the occipital region. The upper side of the skull is
  hardly convex, and the interorbital region is large, but only slightly
  depressed along its middle line. The bill is stout, almost straight, a
  good deal enlarged at its base and rounded beneath. The nostrils are
  large and preceded by a large groove, which extends very far towards the
  tip.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to confound this skull with that of any Bittern, the
  latter having the beak relatively slender and only barely exceeding the
  skull in length. These also have the skull much constricted at the
  temporal region. The fossil skull from Rodriguez therefore presents
  characters essentially those of a Heron, but differs from all known
  species in its massive appearance. In the Grey, Purple and Goliath
  Herons, as well as in the Egrettes, the head is narrower, more elongated,
  the bill less conical and less strong. In <i>Ardea atricollis</i>, now
  inhabiting Madagascar, the beak much resembles that of our extinct
  species, but it is longer and less enlarged at the base. The interorbital
  area is much wider, while on the other hand the hinder portion of the
  skull is narrower and more elongated, which gives to the skull a totally
  different aspect.</p>

  <p>The feet relatively to the head are extremely short, and from this I
  conclude that we know no species of Heron which can be compared to that
  of Rodriguez. Nevertheless, the tarso-metatarsus presents all the
  characters <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>of <i>Ardea</i>, and is far removed from
  that of <i>Botaurus</i>. The tibia is big and short; it surpasses in
  length the tarso-metatarsus by about a third, as is usual in the Herons;
  but the femur on the contrary is strongly developed, being quite as large
  as in the <i>Ardea cinerea</i>; which shows us that the body of this
  creature was of large size, and that the reduction in size of the feet
  had only taken place at their extremities.</p>

  <p>The sternum is puny and small as compared with the creature's size. It
  is clearly that of a bird not furnished with powerful wings, and is even
  much less elongated than in the Bittern, but the coracoidal bones are
  very long and slender. The wings also were short and feeble, the humerus
  being hardly as big as in <i>Butorides atricapilla</i>. It is
  conspicuously slenderer and shorter than in the Bittern. The main body of
  the bone is slightly curved on the outside, and the lower articular
  condyle is large and flattened. I have not been able to examine any bone
  of the "manus," but the metacarpal bone shows exactly the same
  proportions for the wing as does the humerus, as it also barely reaches
  the size of that of <i>Butorides atricapilla</i>. The measurements are as

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> bones on which
  this species is founded are a pair of ulnae, one radius, four metatarsi,
  and one coracoid. The description is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"The bones in question are all
  considerably shorter than the corresponding bones of <i>A. (Nycticorax)
  megacephala</i>. The metatarsi agree otherwise in every detail with those
  of the latter species; this relative stoutness indicates that they
  belonged to a Night-Heron or Bittern like <i>A. megacephala</i>. The two
  ulnae cannot, unfortunately, be compared with those of <i>A.
  megacephala</i>; their length, 110 mm., compared with the length of the
  humerus of <i>A. megacephala</i>, 119 mm., shows, however, likewise that
  they were those of a considerably smaller bird. The single left coracoid
  agrees in all the features of its dorsal or scapular half with <i>A.
  megacephala</i>, but its ventral or sternal half differs considerably,
  first by the much more strongly marked ridge of the <i>linea
  intermuscularis</i> on its ventral surface, secondly by the almost
  straight instead of inwardly curved margin between the <i>processus
  lateralis</i> and the lateral distal corner of the sternal articulation,
  thirdly by a very low but very distinct and sharp ridge, which arises
  from the median margin of the coracoid, a little above its median
  articulating corner. This roughness or prominent ridge is entirely absent
  in <i>A. megacephala</i> and in all other Herons which we have been able
  to examine, but at least a slight indication of it occurs in an
  individually varying degree in <i>Nycticorax</i> and <i>Botaurus</i>.
  That this coracoid bone belonged, however, to an Ardeine bird is clearly
  indicated by its whole configuration, notably by the shape and position
  of the precoracoid process, the various articulating facets at the dorsal
  end, and the prominent lip on the visceral or internal surface of the
  median portion of the sternal articulating facet."</p>

  <p>Although <i>megacephala</i> and <i>mauritiana</i> have been placed in

<h5 class="mt8"><span class="lg150">PROSOBONIA</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="sm">BP.</span></h5>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>his</span> genus is, in the
  Catalogue of Birds, placed in a section with somewhat long tarsus, the
  latter being longer than the culmen, containing in addition to
  <i>Prosobonia</i> the genera <i>Tringites</i>, and <i>Aechmorhynchus</i>
  (see afterwards), and it differs from the latter by its long hind toe,
  from the former by its square tail. The position of this singular bird
  is, however, not quite certain. The late Henry Seebohm placed it in the
  genus <i>Phegornis</i>, though the latter has no hind toe whatever, and
  it has even&mdash;but doubtless wrongly&mdash;been suggested that it
  belonged to the <i>Rallidae</i>, rather than to the <i>Charadriidae</i>.
  We know only one species. It is true that Dr. Sharpe bestowed a new name
  on the figure of Ellis, which is said to have been taken from an
  Eimeo-specimen, but it is hardly creditable that it belongs to a
  different species. Latham appears to have had three specimens, which were
  all three different from each other. Both Forster and Ellis, in their
  unpublished drawings in the British Museum, as well as Latham, evidently
  considered all three to belong to the same species, and it is not
  advisable now to over-rule their verdict, given with the specimens before
  them, merely on account of the different plumages, since we all know that
  most waders, and especially brightly-coloured ones, differ considerably
  in plumage, according to age and seasons. We are convinced that "<i>P.
  ellisi</i>" has been a younger bird. Sharpe attaches importance to the
  different habitat, but this is no argument in this instance, because
  Eimeo is, at the nearest point, not more than seven and a half miles from
  Tahiti,<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and it is quite
  against all precedents among <i>Charadriidae</i> and beyond all
  plausibility that two such closely situated islands have closely allied
  forms of a Wader.</p>

  <p>I have here given the synonymy of this bird, as it has now been
  generally accepted by Seebohm, Sharpe, and others. An actual comparison
  of the types would, however, be very desirable, but, unfortunately, we do
  not know where the type of Latham is, and if it still exists. Christmas
  Island lies much to the north of the Paumotu group! As no specimens have
  been obtained since the U.S. Exploring Expedition, we may safely suppose
  that the species has ceased to exist for some reason.</p>

  1872, p. 247) described this interesting species as follows: "Olivaceous
  brown, bases of the feathers plumbeous; feathers of the breast slightly
  tipped with pale fulvous, those of the abdomen and flanks with two narrow
  bars of the same colour; <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><i>Young.</i> Uniform brownish black.</p>

  <p>A single specimen and young from Mangare; also a specimen in
  spirits."</p>

  <p>The author knew perfectly well what he was doing when he described
  this excellent species. Sir Walter Buller afterwards (B. New Zealand, Ed.
  I, pp. 179, 180) declared "after carefully comparing it with the type of
  <i>Rallus dieffenbachii</i>, and submitting the matter to the judgment of
  other competent ornithologists, I have no hesitation in considering it
  the same species, in an immature state of plumage." (<i>Sic!</i>)
  Unfortunately, Dr. Sharpe, in the Catalogue of Birds XXIII, repeated
  Buller's error, and, on Plate VI, figured <i>Cabalus modestus</i> under
  the name of <i>Cabalus dieffenbachii</i>, though the latter is not
  congeneric with <i>C. modestus</i>, and must be called <i>Nesolimnas
  dieffenbachii</i>, while the third form included in <i>Cabalus</i> by Dr.
  Sharpe, viz. <i>sylvestris</i> of Lord Howe's Island, must also be
  separated genetically from <i>Cabalus</i>.</p>

  <p>Formerly <i>Cabalus modestus</i> inhabited Great Chatham Island, as
  Dr. Forbes proved by bones found by himself at Warekauri, but when the
  species was discovered it existed there no more, though being plentiful
  on the little outlying island of Mangare. Unfortunately even there it is
  evidently extinct now, this island being overrun with cats and rats,
  besides which, according to Buller, the original vegetation has been
  ruthlessly burnt down for the purpose of sowing grass-seed, as even this
  bleak little island has been claimed by an enterprising sheep-farmer.
  Fortunately a good many specimens have been secured by the late W.
  Hawkins. I have fifteen in my museum, and there are specimens in the
  British Museum, in Liverpool, and one in Cambridge. Henry Palmer failed
  to get specimens when he visited Mangare.</p>

  <p>I have also the egg described and figured in the Ibis by Dr. Forbes.
  It measures 40 by 21.4 mm., and is creamy white, with faint pale reddish
  and purplish roundish spots.</p>

  from the Chatham Islands, 500 miles E.S.E. of New Zealand. It appears to
  have been confined to the Island of Wharekauri. Dr. Forbes subsequently
  went to the Chathams himself and collected a large number of bones of
  various extinct birds, including those of <i>Diaphorapteryx</i>. In 1895
  I received a consignment of bones through the agency of Mr. Dannefaerd,
  from the Chathams, such as has never been equalled from any deposit
  elsewhere, for literally there were many hundreds of thousands of bones
  of a considerable number of species of birds. From this collection Mr. C.
  W. Andrews was able to draw up a most minute description of the skeleton
  of <i>Diaphorapteryx</i>, founded on several practically complete
  skeletons, some thirty or more skulls, and several thousand individual
  bones of various portions of the skeleton. This description, published in

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>his</span> species was
  founded on a nearly entire skull, collected by Walter Mantell at
  Waingongoro, North Island, New Zealand. This skull is more than twice the
  size of that of <i>Porphyrio melanotus</i>. The basisphenoidal surface,
  however, is flatter, the anterior angle projects below the base of the
  presphenoid, and there is a slender ridge continued from each
  paroccipital to the lateral angles of the platform, the posterior angles
  being hemispheric tubercles as in <i>Palapteryx</i>.</p>

  <p>The occipital region inclines forwards as it rises, while the same is
  more vertical in <i>Porphyrio</i>. The post-frontal is broader than in
  <i>Porphyrio</i>. The chief distinction from that of <i>Porphyrio</i> is,
  however, the almost regular four-sided figure of the skull. The breadth
  of the anterior part is almost exactly that of the occipital region, and
  the extent of the sides is not much more than that of the front and back
  part. The parieto-frontal region of the skull is very unlike that of
  <i>Porphyrio</i>, being convex and oblong, and <i>Notornis</i> also lacks
  cerebral or hemispheric convexities. Owen gives a large number of other
  differences, but I refer my readers to the original article as above, pp.
  366-371. I, however, must state here, as is already mentioned by Mr.
  Hamilton, Trans. N.Z. Inst. XXIV, p. 176, 1892, that the <i>Dinornis</i>
  skull, with which Professor Owen compared <i>Notornis</i>, referred by
  him to <i>D. casuarinus</i> is really that of <i>Aptornis defossor</i>
  (<i>vide</i> Trans. Zool. Soc. III, pl. 52, figs. 1-7), and, therefore,
  it is quite natural that Professor Owen found a great likeness to
  <i>Dinornis</i> in <i>Notornis</i>, as the skull he compared it with was
  really that of the Ralline <i>Aptornis</i>, and not the Struthious
  <i>Dinornis</i> at all.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> first to point out
  the differences between the bird now in the Liverpool Museum and the
  specimen in Vienna was Mr. Dawson Rowley. The original description of the
  anonymous author of Phillip's Voyage is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"This beautiful bird greatly resembles the purple Gallinule in shape
  and make, but is much superior in size, being as large as a dunghill
  fowl. The length from end of bill to that of the claws is two feet three
  inches. The bill is very stout, and the colour of it, the whole of the
  top of the head and the irides red; the sides of the head round the eyes
  are reddish, very thinly sprinkled with white feathers; the whole of the
  plumage is, without exception, white. The legs the colour of the bill.
  This species is pretty common on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and
  other places, and is a very tame species. The other sex, supposed to be
  the male, is said to have some blue on the wings."</p>

  <p>Gray states under <i>Porphyrio alba</i>, in Ibis 1862, p. 214: "It is
  stated that a similar kind was found on Lord Howe Island which was
  incapable of flight. The wings of the male were beautifully mottled with
  blue."</p>

  <p>Dr. H. O. Forbes, in the Bulletin of the Liverpool Museums, Vol. III,
  No. 2, pp. 62-68 (1901), gives an exhaustive account of Rowley's type, in
  which he comes to the conclusion that the bird is not a <i>Porphyrio</i>
  but a <i>Notornis</i>, and that it is also probably a specimen of
  <i>Notornis alba</i>. That it is a <i>Notornis</i> I equally believe; but
  I think the length of the wing-coverts in the type of <i>N. alba</i>,
  puts it out of the question that the two birds could be the same.
  Moreover, the two original pictures of Phillip and White show this
  difference of the wings very well. I have therefore kept the two
  separate, and I feel sure if we had other specimens with exact data we
  should find this a parallel case to that of <i>Nesonetta aucklandica</i>
  of the Auckland Islands and <i>Anas chlorotis</i> of New Zealand, and
  that <i>Notornis alba</i> of Norfolk Island was a still further
  degenerate form to the already flightless <i>N. stanleyi</i> of Lord Howe
  Island. Wing nine inches.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>here</span> has been
  considerable confusion in connection with this bird and the following
  species, owing to the fact of White not having given any locality for the
  specimen on which Latham founded his <i>Gallinula alba</i>, and which is
  now in the Vienna Museum. That the Vienna specimen is really White's bird
  is proved because it was bought at the sale of the Leverian Museum, and
  White expressly states that all his birds were deposited in the Leverian
  Museum.</p>

  <p>It is quite impossible to say with <i>certainty</i> which of the two
  forms, <i>Notornis alba</i> or <i>N. stanleyi</i>, came from Norfolk
  Island, as we have no indication of the origin of the Liverpool specimen.
  But seeing that in the anonymous work, "The Voyage of Governor Phillip to
  Botany Bay," the first mentioned habitat is Lord Howe Island, and the
  figure shows a bird with the shorter wing-coverts of <i>N. stanleyi</i>,
  I think I am justified in taking the bird with longer
  wing-coverts&mdash;viz., <i>Notornis alba</i>, to be the bird from
  Norfolk Island.</p>

  <p>White's description is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"White Fulica, with bill and front red,
  shoulders spined, legs and feet yellow." White's figure clearly shows the
  long wing coverts characteristic of the genus <i>Notornis</i>. Von
  Pelzeln says in his account of this bird that there is a label on it
  bearing the number 102, and giving as place of origin Norfolk Island, but
  White makes no mention of this. There are traces of a bluish shade, and
  two or three dark spots on the plumage, which has led many ornithologists
  to consider <i>N. alba</i> an albino. Gray, in "A List of Birds from New
  Zealand, &amp;c.,"<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  remarked that some Norfolk Island specimens had blue between the
  shoulders, and the back spotted with the same colour. He also states that
  the young are said to be black, then become bluish grey, and afterwards
  pure white. From these and other authors' similar remarks I believe we
  have not here a case of albinism, but a bird which was in a stage of
  evolution towards becoming a fixed white species. Wing 9 inches (measured
  by myself in the Vienna Museum).</p>

  have the plumage entirely blue, the beak and the feet red and made like
  those of fowls; they do not fly at all, but run extremely quickly, so
  that a dog can hardly catch them; they are very good."</p>

  <p>Habitat: Bourbon or Réunion.</p>

  <p>Dubois gives the size of these birds as the same as that of a big
  goose and the feet as being like those of a fowl: I have, therefore, in
  reconstructing the plate of this bird, had it made intermediate in
  structure between the New Zealand <i>Notornis</i> and <i>Aptornis</i>,
  which were evidently its nearest allies.</p>

  <i>Fulica newtoni</i>; like the bones of <i>Aphanapteryx</i> (should be

  am inclined to consider them as belonging to different species, or at
  least different races. I have given the name <i>Fulica chathamensis</i>"
  to the larger species.</p>

  <p>Later, in the Ibis, Dr. Forbes says, "The limb-bones and pelvis
  correspond so closely to those of <i>F. newtoni</i> that I am not able to
  separate them. The head of the type is, however, unknown."</p>

  <p>Professor Milne-Edwards, however, points out numerous differences. In
  the humerus the sub-trochanterial groove is bigger, and particularly
  wider than in typical <i>Fulica</i>. The iliac grooves are larger than in
  <i>Fulica newtoni</i>, the pelvic knob is more extended, and the sciatic
  foramen is larger. The first sacral vertebrae are stunted below the
  median sinus, while in the Mauritius species one observes a very stout
  one, occupying the four first vertebrae of the pelvis. The feet were also
  larger and stronger than in the latter.</p>

  white, except a little place under their wings, which is reddish. They
  have a goose's bill, only a little sharper; their claws are very long and
  divided." This bird was apparently confined to the island of
  Mauritius.</p>

  <p>Professor Newton asserts that Leguat's "Géants" were Flamingos,
  principally because bones of Flamingos have been found in Mauritius and
  not a single bone has ever been got of the "géant." This argument is, in
  my opinion, insufficient, and no evidence at all. We know that a Didine
  bird and a gigantic rail existed on Réunion, but no bones are yet known
  of these. I think, like Professor Schlegel, that Leguat's figure and
  description cannot be meant for a Flamingo and that they prove the former
  existence of a gigantic ralline bird in Mauritius.</p>

  <p>The figure is made up from Leguat's description. The bill is drawn
  like that of a gigantic moorhen, and so are the feet.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">P</span>robably</span> the first
  mention of Great Auks is that in André Thevet's book "Les singularitéz de
  la France antarctique ...," Anvers 1558, where a large bird was mentioned
  under the name of "Aponars," Apponatz or "Aponath." But evidently this
  name covered several other sea-birds, and it is at least doubtful if it
  was solely applied to the Great Auk. The same applies to the remarks by
  Jacques Cartier, as translated in R. Hakluyt's collection of voyages. On
  the other hand there is no doubt that the "Penguin" mentioned by Robert
  Hore in 1536 (Hakluyt, Collection of Voyages III, p. 129&mdash;1600, and
  other Editions) was actually the Great Auk. In fact "Penguin" has been
  the name usually applied to the Great Auk <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>and is even now used
  for it by the French, while in most other languages it has been
  transferred, from an early date, to the Antarctic flightless birds, the
  <i>Spheniscidae</i>.</p>

  <p>All the first reports are from Newfoundland and thereabout, and even
  Clusius (Exoticorum libri decem, Lib. V, p. 103&mdash;1605), who gives a
  rather poor but perfectly recognizable figure, describes it first (p.
  103) as a native of America, under the name of "Mergus Americanus." Later
  on, however, in the "Auctarium," on p. 367, he mentions it, on the
  authority of Henricus Hojerus, as found in the Faröe Islands, under the
  name "Goirfugel." Hojerus was also the authority for the account given in
  Nieremberg, Hist. Nat., etc., p. 215 (1635). The first comparatively good
  figure was published in 1655, in the "Museum Wormianum," on p. 301, from
  a specimen brought alive from the Faröe Islands. Curiously enough the
  figure shows a white ring round the neck, which no Great Auk, of course,
  possesses.</p>

  <p>Linnaeus, when first bestowing a scientific name on the Great Auk, in
  1758, l.c., gave the following short diagnosis and <span

  <p>From referring to the literature he quotes, there can, of course, be
  no doubt as to what species he refers.</p>

  <p>The most detailed descriptions are probably those given in the New
  Edition of Naumann (see above), where also a list of literature and
  figures is given, fully seven folio pages long! As regards the difference
  in the sexes little is known, because very few specimens exist of which
  the sex has been ascertained. We find, however, some with the grooves and
  ridges on the bill more marked, and the grooves purer white, while others
  have the grooves of a dirtier white and less strongly developed; as these
  latter are apparently mostly smaller, I think they must be females, the
  former males. In this case my two specimens would be females, and the one
  now in Professor Koenig's possession an adult male. Probably somewhat
  similar seasonal changes took place as in <i>Alca torda</i>, and
  Professor Blasius (l.c.) has described them. It must, however, be
  remembered, that the date of capture is known of but a few examples, and
  that by far the majority of all those that exist in collections have been
  killed in spring, on their breeding-places.</p>

  <p>Nobody can doubt that the Great Auk is extinct. The last specimens
  were obtained on Eldey, near Iceland, in 1844, and the seas and islands
  <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span>where the great bird used to live are
  frequented by vessels every year. It is true that a certain Lorenz
  Brodtkorb told that in April, 1848, he saw four Great Auks, of which he
  shot one, near the Varanger Fjord, east of the North-Cape, but Professor
  Newton and Wolley have, in 1855, had an interview with Brodtkorb, and
  came to the conclusion that he saw and shot the Great Northern Diver.
  This is the more likely to be the case, as the occurrence north of the
  Arctic Circle is as yet uncertain, the finding of Great Auks both on the
  island of Disco (west-coast of Greenland) and on Grimsey and Mevenklint
  on the north coast of Iceland being open to doubt.</p>

  <p>From sub-fossil and prehistoric finds, we know that the Great Auk
  formerly inhabited Norway and Sweden, Denmark, with Seeland, Sejerö and
  Havnö, the British Islands (Cleadon Hills in County Durham, Scotland,
  Ireland), the east coast of North America from Labrador to Florida.</p>

  <p>In historic times we know of the occurrence on the islands near
  Labrador, Greenland&mdash;where it certainly used to breed on the east
  coast, but was probably only of rare and exceptional occurrence on the
  west coast&mdash;Iceland, the Faröe Islands, Fair Island between the
  Orkney and Shetland Islands (doubtful), Orkneys (Papa Westra), St. Kilda,
  Skye, and Waterford Harbour in Ireland. But as breeding stations within
  historic times the following only are absolutely <span
  class="nw">certain:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>While we know of regular occurrence and may assume that the bird has
  been breeding on the north and west side of Newfoundland, and in east
  Greenland (opposite Iceland).</p>

  <p>The remains of the Great Auk and its eggs in collections are more
  numerous than one would think, considering the enormous prices paid for
  mounted specimens and eggs. There are at present known 79 or 80 skins, 26
  or 27 skeletons, a great quantity of detached bones, and about 73
  eggs.</p>

<h5>I HAVE IN MY MUSEUM:</h5>

  <p>1. One adult female, formerly in the collection of the late Comte de
  Riocour at Vitry-le-François, in France. I bought this specimen from the
  late Alphonse Boucard, together with the bulk of the birds of the Riocour
  collection. It is evidently an adult female, having the white lines on
  the bill not very much developed, and showing a distinct grey tinge on
  the flanks. This shade is present in both my Great Auks; the feathers of
  the flanks, just under the wing, are nearly white, with a conspicuous,
  very light grey border. This grey tinge is present in all females, but
  appears to be absent in adult males. My bird is apparently in worn
  breeding plumage. As it was not very well mounted and the feet slightly
  damaged, I had it reduced to a "skin."</p>

<p><!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span></p>

  <p>2. Another adult female. I purchased this from Mr. Rowland Ward, who
  had it from Mr. Leopold Field in London, in 1897. According to a letter,
  dated Paris le 20 Jan., 1890, written by the late A. Boucard, who sold it
  in that year to Mr. Field, the history is as follows: "This bird was
  captured in Iceland in 1837, did first belong to Mr. Eimbeck of Brunswick
  and afterwards in the collection of Mr. Bruch from Mayence." We must
  accept this information by the late A. Boucard as correct, though it is
  difficult to understand that in the most painstaking and exact list of
  remains of the Great Auk, by Prof. Wilhelm Blasius of Braunschweig, or
  anywhere else, no mention is made of a specimen in the possession of the
  late Eimbeck, or the late Bruch. Moreover, we have no explanation where
  this Auk has been between the time of Bruch's death and 1890, when
  Boucard sold it to Mr. Field in London.</p>

  <p>This specimen has been described as "immature," but this is a mistake.
  Evidently it arose from some white speckles being visible on the neck
  <i>in the photograph</i> (see Symington Grieve, Trans. Edinburgh Field
  Nat. and Micros. Society, explanation to plate III, on page 269). The
  specimen itself, however, shows no white speckles, but only worn
  feathers, out of which the illusion arose in the photograph. This error
  has also been transferred to the admirable treatise on the Great Auk in
  the New Edition of Naumann. The grey shade "on the body lower than the
  wing," mentioned by Mr. Symington Grieve, is not a sign of immaturity,
  but appears in all adult females, though it is said to be absent in
  males.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Some years ago an extraordinary rumour was current in Germany about
  the Great Auk in the Brehm collection; it was said to have been exchanged
  by the widow of Pastor C. L. Brehm for a rare Dresden cup, and that its
  present resting-place was unknown. I do not know who invented this story,
  or how it arose, but suffice it to say, that the Auk which was in the
  Brehm collection was sold to the late King of Italy, in 1868 or 1869. The
  business was concluded by Dr. Otto Finsch, and the money was used for the
  benefit of a brother of the late Dr. A. E. Brehm, as it had been the wish
  of his father, Pastor Brehm. The specimen was re-stuffed by the late
  taxidermist Schwerdtfeger in Bremen and forwarded to a professor in
  Florence. It was kept for years at the "Veneria Reale," and recently,
  when the collection at that castle was dissolved, was placed in the
  Museum at Rome. It is one of the finest Great Auks known.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">I</span>t</span> is surprising that
  the name <i>jamaicensis</i> has generally been adopted for this species,
  as Bancroft gave no description whatever. The first description is that
  of Carte, in 1866, which is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"Head, neck, back, and wings of a
  uniform dark sooty brown; vertex and external webs of the primaries a
  shade or so darker; abdominal feathers and under tail-coverts a shade or
  two lighter than those of the back; upper tail-coverts and basal portion
  of tail-feathers of a light grey or dirty white. The light-coloured patch
  on the rump is conspicuous when the wings are expanded, but completely
  concealed when they are closed. Irides dark hazel. Tarsi, toes, webs, and
  nails jet-black.</p>

  <p>"Length about 12¾ inches; expanse of wings 34 inches; length from
  carpal joint to tip of first primary 10¾ inches; length of bill, measured
  from gape, 1&#x215D; inches; length of nasal tubes <span
  class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> inch; length of
  interval between nostrils and commencement of apical curve of upper

  class="suu">10</span> inches; length of toes, outer and middle, sub-equal
  2 inches; length of inner toe 1&#x215D; inches. First and second
  primaries sub-equal, and about ½ inch longer than the third. Tail about
  4½ inches long and round at extremity. The closed wings extend about 1½
  inches beyond the tail. Hallux small, and in shape triangular."</p>

  <p>"With respect to the habits of the bird, Mr. March has most kindly
  furnished me with the following interesting <span
  class="nw">details:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"It is a night-bird, living in burrows in the marly clefts of the
  mountains at the east and north-east end of the island. The burrows form
  a gallery 6 to 10 feet long, terminating in a chamber sufficiently
  commodious to accommodate the pair; from this they sally forth at night,
  flying over the sea in search of food (fishes), returning before dawn. It
  is often seen on moonlight nights and at sunrise running about the
  neighbourhood of its domicile, and sometimes crossing the road,
  regardless of the labourers going to their work. I know nothing of its
  nidification." <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>The type of "<i>Pterodroma caribbaea</i>" is preserved in the Dublin
  Museum, and three specimens are in the British Museum. This bird is one
  of the rarest in collections, and all modern collectors have failed to
  obtain specimens. Quite recently (1906) Mr. B. Hyatt Verrill published a
  pamphlet entitled "Additions to the Avifauna of Dominica." In this
  unpaginated essay he said under the heading "<i>Aestrelata
  jamaicensis</i>": "Not uncommon (on Dominica), but seldom seen during the
  day. Breeds at La Bime, Pointe Guignarde, and Lance Bateaux, as well as
  at Morne Rouge and Scott's Head. In many of the above localities the
  musky odour of these birds is very pronounced when passing the cliffs,
  wherein they breed, on a calm evening. At dusk they may often be seen
  flying about the cliffs in company with myriads of bats that spend the
  day in the fissures and crevices. They are very difficult to procure, and
  although shot at repeatedly only two specimens have been obtained."</p>

  <p>From all former evidence we might have well considered this species to
  be extinct, but if Mr. Verrill's statement is correct it would be far
  from exterminated. I do not, however, know if the Dominica specimens have
  been compared with Jamaica examples, and if Mr. Verrill's determination
  (apparently made on Dominica) is therefore correct.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">M</span>r. Saunders</span> describes
  this bird as follows: "The adult has the crown and nape dark brown,
  hind-neck white, cheeks and ear-coverts greyish; mantle dark brown; upper
  tail-coverts white; central tail-feathers chiefly brownish-black, the
  rest more or less white on their basal portions but broadly edged with
  brown; forehead and under-parts white; bill black; legs and feet
  dusky-yellow. Length 16 inches, wing 11.3 inches. The immature bird is
  believed to be mottled with brown on the forehead and to be duller in
  tint on the upper parts."</p>

  <p>Though evidently not quite extinct, it seems certain that the fate of
  this bird is sealed. In former times it used to breed in great numbers on
  several of the West Indian Islands: Hayti, Guadeloupe, and Dominica. Its
  last breeding place was the Morne au Diable or Morne Diablotin on
  Dominica. There it was searched for in vain by Colonel Feilden, in 1889,
  who wrote a lengthy article about it in the "Trans. Norfolk and Norwich
  Nat. Society" V. p. 24-39. Mr. Selwyn Branch again, ten years later,
  ascended La Morne au Diable, and found the old breeding places deserted.
  The "Manicou," evidently an introduced North-American Opossum, Mongoose
  and rats had entirely extirpated the "Diable."</p>

  <p>Two-and-a-half centuries ago Père du Tertre found this Petrel breeding
  on Guadeloupe, and Père Labat, about forty years later, found it in great
  numbers, and gave a long, graphic description of it in his "Nouveau
  Voyage aux isles de l'Amérique" (Edit. I, Vol. II, pp. 349-353). These
  birds were then known as the "Diable" or "Diablotin," and their flesh was
  highly esteemed, and they were even salted and exported to Martinique and
  other French islands in great numbers. <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span></p>

  <p>In 1876 Mr. F. A. Ober searched already unsuccessfully for our
  birds.</p>

  <p>It seems that the disturbance and destruction on their breeding places
  has scattered these Petrels about, for specimens have at various times
  been taken on the coast of Florida and Virginia, and even as late as 1893
  and 1895, inland of the State of New York on Oneida Lake, in Ulster
  County, Vermont and Ontario; moreover, a specimen has been killed in 1850
  in Norfolk, England, and an example in the Museum of Boulogne is said to
  have been killed in the neighbourhood of that town.</p>

  <p>In an undated and unpaginated pamphlet, received last year in Europe,
  Mr. A. Hyatt Verrill informs us that this bird is "not uncommon on the
  fishing grounds and in Martinique and Guadeloupe channels," and that he
  took a specimen in September, 1904. This statement requires
  confirmation.</p>

  <p>In collections this bird is very rare. I have the male (in moult)
  which was caught on August 28th, 1893 on Oneida Lake, in the State of New
  York.</p>

  than the European Woodpigeon; the feathers of the head, neck and breast
  are long, narrow, and end in a point. These feathers are rather curiously
  constructed, they have the polish, brilliancy, and feel of a
  cartilaginous blade. I could not, with the aid of a lens, distinguish
  whether these blades were formed by the conglomeration of the barbules,
  but we may take it for granted that they are constituted in a like manner
  to the wing appendages of the Bohemian Waxwing and the cartilaginous
  blades of Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl. The eye is surrounded by naked skin of

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> original
  description of the sternum is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"It belongs to a species small in size,
  barely as large as <i>T. tympanistria</i>, but evidently much better
  built for flight. In fact the most striking characters of this sternum
  are the large size of the bouclier, the large size of the lateral
  notches, and the shape of the keel, whose anterior angle is not much
  produced in front. The coracoidal grooves are large and only slightly
  oblique. The lateral branches detach themselves from the bone in front of
  the costal facets&mdash;they are very widely spread, and stretch more
  directly outwards than in the remainder of the species of the family. The
  lower lateral branches are equally divergent, and the median blade of the
  posterior edge is remarkable from its enlargement. The keel is moderately
  prominent, its anterior angle is much rounded, and does not reach the
  level of the episternal apophysis, as is the case, as a rule, in the
  pigeons. All these peculiarities, to which must be added the general
  flattening of the bone which is hardly at all sloped like a roof,
  separate the pigeon of Rodriguez very widely, not only from
  <i>Erythroena</i> and <i>Turtur</i>, but also from <i>Vinago</i>. In its
  shape in general, by the little pronounced keel and the direction of the
  latter, this sternum presents certain analogies to the essentially
  arboreal species such as those of the genus <i>Carpophaga</i>, but they
  all differ in having the space for the costal facets on the sides of the
  sternum much more extended, the superior lateral branches larger, and the
  latter arising further back, so that the lateral notches are smaller. Up
  to the present I do not know any genus of the family of <i>Columbidae</i>
  in which the sternum can at all be likened to that found recently in
  Rodriguez, and therefore in all probability this fossil remainder is of
  yet another vanished species, which I propose to call <i>Columba
  rodericana</i>." (Translated.)</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> following is the
  description by Salvadori in the "Catalogue of Birds":&mdash;"Head, neck
  and underparts pale pink, fading into whitish towards the forehead,
  cheeks and upper throat, and passing into rather darker pink on the
  mantle; remainder of the upper back and the entire wings brown, with a
  slight shade of olive and rufous; lower back and rump greyish, the latter
  mottled with chestnut; upper tail coverts and tail cinnamon, the outer
  tail feathers fading into buff on the outer webs and towards the tips;
  undertail-coverts pink, like the mantle; undersurface of the wings ashy
  brown, slightly pale on the axillaries, and under wing-coverts iris
  yellow; bill yellow, shaded with red towards the base; legs red (fide
  Shelley). Total length about 15.5 inches, wing 8.5, tail 6.5, bill 0.86,
  tarsus 1.3."</p>

  <p>In the live bird the pink soon fades away almost entirely, and the
  olive shade on the wings is strongly developed.</p>

  <p>This bird was not found by the Rev. H. H. Slater, during his visit to
  Mauritius. As observed by Mons. Paul Carié (Ornis XII, p. 127), the idea
  that it is extinct is, however, incorrect, as it can still easily be
  procured, though it is rare. M. Georges Antelme, of Mauritius, possesses
  the eggs of this pigeon. That it still exists is also evident from two
  specimens which were sent to the Zoological Gardens, London, last year,
  and are still living there.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">I</span>t</span> is true that
  Linnaeus' diagnosis of his <i>Columba macroura</i> is very short,
  reading, as it does, as follows: "Columba cauda cuneiformi longa, pectore
  purpurascente." These words, however, are clearly taken from Catesby, who
  gives an excellent figure and description, as is also the "Habitat,"
  viz.: <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>Habitat in Canada, hybernat in Carolina,
  though Linnaeus first quotes Edwards 15, pl. 15, where an entirely
  different bird is described and figured. (Cf. Bangs, l.c.)</p>

  <p>The Passenger Pigeon in former times occurred throughout North America
  in great abundance, from the Atlantic to the great Central Plains, and
  from the Southern States, where it rarely occurred, north to at least 62°
  northern latitude. Being a migrant, this bird used to migrate southwards
  after the breeding season, and to return to their homes in spring, but it
  also shifted its quarters according to the abundance or scarcity of food,
  like our Pigeons. Sometimes incredible numbers flocked together. Such
  stupendous flights have been described independently by Audubon, Wilson
  and others. In 1813 Audubon says that during his whole journey from
  Hardensburg to Louisville, fifty-five miles, countless masses of Pigeons
  continued to pass over, and also did so during the three following days.
  "At times they flew so low, that multitudes were destroyed, and for many
  days the entire population seemed to eat nothing else but Pigeons." Where
  they roosted in millions, the dung soon covered the ground and destroyed
  the grass and undergrowth, limbs and even small trees broke down from the
  weight of the birds. "One of the breeding places visited by Wilson, not
  far from Shelbyville, Kentucky, stretched through the forest in nearly a
  north and south direction. This was several miles in breadth, and upwards
  of forty miles in extent. In this immense tract nearly every tree was
  furnished with nests wherever there were branches to accommodate them. He
  was informed by those who sought to plunder the nests of the squabs, that
  the noise in the woods was so great as to terrify their horses, and that
  it was difficult for one person to hear another speak. The ground was
  strewed with broken limbs, eggs and young Pigeons. Hawks were sailing
  about in great numbers, while from twenty feet upwards to the tops of the
  trees there was a perpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering multitudes
  of Pigeons, their wings resounding like thunder, and mingled with the
  frequent crash of falling trees. In one instance he counted ninety nests
  in a single tree."</p>

  <p>It is only natural that man took advantage of such vast multitudes,
  and that they were killed in great numbers, for food, and, maybe,
  sometimes wantonly destroyed. Yet it is difficult to understand what
  brought on their total destruction, as their power of flight was great,
  and their vision remarkably keen. In 1874 Messrs. Baird, Brewer and
  Ridgway considered them still common birds, though "their abundance in
  large extents of the country had <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>been very sensibly
  reduced." At that time "in the New England States and in the more
  cultivated part of the country, these birds no longer bred in large
  communities. The instance near Montpelier, in 1849, is the only marked
  exception that has come within my knowledge. They now breed in isolated
  pairs, their nests being scattered through the woods and seldom near one
  another." In 1895, in the A.O.U. check-list, the authors say: "Breeding
  range now mainly restricted to portions of the Canadas and the northern
  borders of the United States, as far west as Manitoba and the
  Dakotas."</p>

  <p>At the present time the Passenger Pigeon seems to have entirely
  disappeared, a small flock in an aviary apparently being all that is left
  of it alive. Mr. James H. Fleming, of Toronto, kindly sends me the
  following notes, which I think are of the greatest <span
  class="nw">interest:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The disappearance of the Passenger Pigeon in Ontario dates back at
  least forty years, though as late as 1870 some of the old roosts were
  still frequented, but the incredible flocks, of which so much has been
  said, had gone long before that date, and by 1880 the pigeon was
  practically exterminated, not only in Ontario, but over the greater part
  of its old range. There are however occasional records of birds taken,
  for some years later. An immature bird taken September 9, 1887, in
  Chester County, Pennsylvania, is said to be the last for that part of the
  State<a name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; a bird, also
  immature, is in my collection, taken in December, 1888, at Montreal,
  Quebec. There are other Montreal records of the same date,<a name="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> but with the exception of one taken at
  Tadousac, July 26, 1889,<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  these are the last Quebec records of birds actually taken. In Ontario two
  were taken at Toronto in 1890, on September 20, and October 11, both
  immature females, the latter is in my collection, as is an adult female
  taken by Mr. Walter Brett, at Riding Mountain, Manatoba, May 12, 1892,
  one of a pair seen. I also have an adult male taken at Waukegon,
  Illinois, December 19, 1892. I was in New York in the latter part of
  November, 1892, and was then assured by Mr. Rowland, a well known
  taxidermist, that he had recently seen several barrels of pigeons that
  had been condemned as unfit for food; they had come to New York from
  Indian Territory, and I believe had had their tails pulled out to permit
  tighter packing. Mr. William Brewster has recorded the sending of several
  hundred dozens of pigeons to the Boston market in December of the same
  year, and in January, 1893; these were also from Indian Territory<a
  name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>; these are the last records
  we have of the Passenger Pigeon as anything more than a casual migrant.
  The records ceased after this till 1898, when three birds were taken at
  points widely apart, <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>an adult male at Winnipegosis, Manatoba,
  on April 14,<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> an immature
  male at Owensboro, Kentucky, on July 27, now in the Smithsonian
  Institution, and another immature bird taken at Detroit, Michigan, on
  September 14, now in my collection; these are the last records that can
  be based on specimens.</p>

  <p>"In 1903 I published a list including sight records, one as late as
  May, 1902; this latter is possibly open to doubt, but the ones I gave for
  1900 are, I feel confident, correct, as the birds were seen more than
  once and by different observers. For all practical purposes, the close of
  the Nineteenth Century saw the final extinction of the Passenger Pigeon
  in a wild state, and there remained only the small flock, numbering in
  1903 not more than a dozen, that had been bred in captivity by Prof. C.
  O. Whitman, of Chicago; these birds are the descendants of a single pair,
  and have long ago ceased to breed. It was in an effort to obtain fresh
  blood for this flock that I started a newspaper enquiry that brought many
  replies, none of which could be substantiated as records of the Passenger
  Pigeon, and many referred to the Mourning Dove. I am aware that there has
  been lately wide-spread and persistent rumours of the return of the
  pigeons, but no rumour has borne investigation, and I feel that Prof.
  Whitman's small flock, now reduced (in 1906) to five birds, are the last
  representatives of a species around whose disappearance mystery and fable
  will always gather."</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> first description
  of this very remarkable bird was given in the account of the voyage of
  Admiral Jacob van Neck in 1598, which was published by Corneille Nicolas
  at Amsterdam in 1601. It is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span>"Blue parrots are very numerous there,
  as well as other birds; among which are a kind, conspicuous for their
  size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only half covered with skin
  as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings, in the place of which
  3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists of a few soft
  incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to call
  'Walghvögel,' for the reason that the longer and oftener they were
  cooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless
  their belly and breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily
  masticated."</p>

  <p>In a large number of works on travel and voyages published in the 17th
  and 18th Centuries we find all sorts of notices about the Dodo, and
  numerous pictures of which I have given outline drawings. From these
  sources it appears that the Dodo became extinct about the end of the 17th
  Century, <i>i.e.</i>, 1680-1690. The causes of the extermination of this,
  perhaps the best known and most talked about of the recently extinct
  birds, are not far to seek. The total inability of flight, the heavy slow
  gait, and the utter fearlessness from long immunity from enemies, led to
  a continual slaughter for food by the sailors and others who came to and
  dwelt on Mauritius. But the final cause of the extermination of this and
  many other birds in the Mascarene Islands was probably the introduction
  of pigs, and also of the Ceylon Monkey. These animals increased
  enormously in numbers, ran wild in the woods, and soon destroyed all the
  eggs and young birds they could find. <!-- Page 173 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span></p>

  <p>It is strange that for many years after great attention had been paid
  to the <i>Dodo</i>, ornithologists differed conspicuously as to what
  family it and the other two Didine species belonged. Many asserted that
  it was a Struthious bird, in fact Linnaeus called it calmly <i>Struthio
  cucullatus</i>, while others just as forcibly declared it to be an
  abnormal Vulture. The truth is, that although the <i>Didunculus
  strigirostis</i> of Samoa, which was supposed to be its near
  representative, is not at all closely allied, yet the two species of
  <i>Didus</i> and <i>Pezophaps solitarius</i> form a group of very
  specialized pigeons.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> Didine bird of
  Réunion was first mentioned by Mr. Tatton, the Chief Officer of Captain
  Castleton, in his account of their voyage given in Purchas his Pilgrimes.
  His account is as <span class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"There is store of land fowle both small and great, plenty of Doves,
  great Parrats, and such like; and a great fowle of the bignesse of a
  Turkie, very fat, and so short winged, that they cannot fly, being white,
  and in a manner tame: and so be all other fowles, as having not been
  troubled nor feared with shot. Our men did beat them down with sticks and
  stones. Ten men may take fowle enough to serve fortie men a day."</p>

  <p>We then find frequent mention of this bird by Bontekoe in 5 separate
  treatises or editions, from 1646 to 1650, and by Carré in 1699. But the
  first more detailed description is given by the Sieur D.B. (Dubois) in
  1674, which is as <span class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"<i>Solitaires.</i> These birds are thus named because they always go
  alone. They are as big as a big goose and have white plumage, black at
  the extremity of the wings and of the tail. At the tail there are some
  feathers resembling those of the Ostrich. They have the neck long and the
  beak formed like that of the Woodcocks (he refers to the woodrails,
  <i>Erythromachus</i>&mdash;W.R.), but larger, and the legs and feet like
  those of Turkey-chicks. This bird betakes itself to running, only flying
  but very little. It is the best game on the Island." <!-- Page 176
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span></p>

  <p>It will be seen that, while Dubois says the wings and tail are black,
  Pierre Witthoos's picture, from which the accompanying plate was partly
  drawn, shows the wings yellow. This may either be due to Dubois' faulty
  description, or, what is much more probable, the bird brought to
  Amsterdam, which Witthoos painted, was somewhat albinistic. The bill in
  the picture by Witthoos shows a distinctly mutilated bill, evidently done
  by the bird's keeper to prevent being injured by the formidable hook of
  the untrimmed bill. In addition to two pictures (the one formerly in the
  possession of Mr. C. Dare, of Clatterford, in the Isle of Wight, and a
  second in Holland, both by Pieter Witthoos, painted about the year 1670),
  we know of this bird only the drawing given in Zaagman's edition of
  Bontekoe, 1646. In all these drawings the first four primaries point down
  and forward, which is probably owing to the injured condition of the
  specimen figured, so in the accompanying plate I had the wing drawn like
  the true Dodo's and the bill reconstructed.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Island of Bourbon or Réunion.</p>

  <p>Only known from the above-mentioned descriptions and two drawings. No
  specimens existing.</p>

  <p>This bird became extinct between the years 1735 and 1801, because in
  the latter year Monsieur Bory St. Vincent made his scientific survey of
  the Island, and no such bird existed then; while we know that Monsieur de
  la Bourdonnaye, who was governor of the Mascarene Islands from 1735 to
  1746, sent one alive to one of the directors of the French East Indian
  Company. Of this, the second living specimen brought to Europe, we
  unfortunately have neither drawing nor history.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>his</span> bird was first
  made known by Leguat in 1708, but some confusion seems to have arisen,
  owing to his applying the same name to them as the Sieur D.B. (Dubois)
  gave to the Bourbon Dodo in 1674. This is the original <span
  class="nw">description:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The feathers of the males are of a brown-grey colour, the feet and
  beak are like a turkey's, but a little more crooked. They have scarce any
  tail, but their hind part covered with feathers is roundish, like the
  crupper of a hare. They are taller than turkeys. Their neck is straight,
  and a little longer in proportion than a turkey's when it lifts up his
  head. Its eye is black and lively, and its head without comb on cop. They
  never fly, their wings are too little to support the weight of their
  bodies; they serve only to beat themselves and flutter when they call one
  another. They will whirl about for twenty or thirty times together on the
  same side during the space of 4 or 5 minutes. The motions of their wings
  make then a noise very like that of a rattle, and one may hear it two
  hundred paces off. The bone of their <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>wings grows greater
  towards the extremity, and forms a little round mass under the feathers
  as big as a musket ball. That and its beak are the chief defences of this
  bird. 'Tis very hard to catch in the woods, but easy in open places,
  because we run faster than they, and sometimes we approach them without
  much trouble. From March to September they are very fat, and taste
  admirably well, especially while they are young, some of the males weigh
  45 pounds. The females are wonderfully beautiful, some fair, some brown.
  I call them fair, because they are the colour of fair hair; they have a
  sort of peak like a widow's, upon their breasts, which is of a dun
  colour. No one feather is straggling from the other all over their
  bodies, they being very careful to adjust themselves, and make them all
  even with their beaks. The feathers on their thighs are round like shells
  at the end, and being there very thick, have an agreeable effect. They
  have two risings on their craws, and the feathers are whiter there than
  the rest, which livelily represents the fine neck of a beautiful woman.
  They walk with so much stateliness and good grace that one cannot help
  admiring them and loving them, by which means their fine mien often saves
  their lives."</p>

  <p>The unfortunate Solitaires, owing to the depredations by the pigs and
  monkeys introduced by the settlers, and the unceasing slaughter by the
  latter, became extinct between the years 1760 and 1780.</p>

  <p>Of their habits we only have the accounts of <span
  class="nw">Leguat:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"Though these birds will sometimes very familiarly come up near enough
  to one, when we do not run after them, yet they will never grow tame, as
  soon as they are caught they shed tears, without crying, and refuse all
  manner of sustenance till they die.</p>

  <p>When these birds build their nests, they choose a clean place, gather
  together some palm leaves for that purpose, and heap them up a foot and a
  half high from the ground, on which they sit. They never lay but one egg,
  which is much bigger than that of a goose. The male and female both cover
  it in their turns, and the young is not hatched till at 7 weeks end. All
  the while they are sitting upon it, or are bringing up their young one,
  which is not able to provide for itself in several months, they will not
  suffer any other bird of their species to come within two hundred yards
  round of the place. But what is very singular is, the males will never
  drive away the females, only when they perceive one they make a noise
  with their wings to call their own female&mdash;she drives away the
  unwelcome stranger, not leaving it till it was without her bounds. The
  female does the same as to males, which she leaves to the male who drives
  them away. We have observed this several times, and I <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>affirm it to
  be true. The combats between them on this occasion last sometimes pretty
  long, because the stranger only turns about, and does not fly directly
  from the nest. However, the others do not forsake it till they have quite
  driven it out of their limits. After these birds have raised their young
  one, and left it to itself, they are always together, which the other
  birds are not, and though they happen to mingle with other birds of the
  same species, these two companions never disunite.</p>

  <p>We have often remarked, that some days after the young one leaves the
  nest, a company of 30 or 40 bring another young one to it, and the new
  fledged bird, joining the band with its father and mother, they march to
  some bye place. We frequently followed them, and found that afterwards
  the old ones went each their way alone, or in couples, and left the two
  young ones together, which we called a marriage."</p>

  <p>Leguat's, d'Heguerty's, and the Abbé Pingré's descriptions were all we
  had of this great ground pigeon down to 1866, except a few bones. When
  Mr. Strickland proved its distinctness from the Dodo of Mauritius in
  1844, and up to 1852, these bones numbered 18. In 1864 Mr. E. Newton and
  Captain Barclay got 3 more bones, in 1865 Mr. Jenner, the resident
  magistrate, collected 8 bones, and in 1866 nearly 2,000 bones were
  collected, but during the Transit of Venus expedition in 1874, a thorough
  search was made, and a number of complete skeletons was collected.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Island of Rodriguez.</p>

  <p>Represented in Museums by a number of complete skeletons and a large
  number of bones.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">L</span>innaeus'</span> brief
  diagnosis is: "Tetrao pedibus hirsutis alis succenturiatis cervicalibus."
  After the habitat he adds: "Color Tetricis feminae; vertex subcristatus;
  a tergo colli duae parvae alae: singulae pennis quinque." This diagnosis
  is taken from Catesby, who gives a fairly good description and a
  recognizable coloured plate. He specially mentions that the neck-tufts
  are composed of five feathers, and in his figure they are shown to be
  much pointed. Catesby expressly states that he does not know exactly from
  which part of America his specimen came&mdash;yet Linnaeus says "Habitat
  in Virginia."</p>

  <p>Formerly the Heath Hen inhabited New England and part of the Middle
  States (Southern Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey, Nantucket, Eastern
  Pennsylvania), but in 1887 Ridgway stated already that it was then
  apparently extinct, except on Martha's Vineyard. About that time it was
  still common on that island, inhabiting the woods and chiefly haunting
  oak scrub and feeding on acorns. They were then "strictly protected by
  law," but this protection seems not to have been effectual, as from 1893
  to 1897 a number were killed, skinned, and sold to various museums. This
  was, perhaps, fortunate rather than unfortunate, because Mr. Hoyle (the
  man who collected them) told us that in 1894 a fire destroyed many of
  them, and in the fall of 1897 they were practically gone. But almost
  worse than this, perhaps, two pairs of "Prairie Chicken" (<i>Tympanuchus
  americanus</i>) were liberated and broods of young (of the latter
  apparently) were seen, so that it <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>is to be feared that
  birds shot now on Martha's Vineyards Island may have blood of <i>T.
  americanus</i> in them, the two forms being closely related, somewhat
  difficult to distinguish, and evidently sub-species of each other.
  Nevertheless, a bird taken in 1901 was pronounced to be typical
  <i>cupido</i> by Mr. Brewster.</p>

  <p>From these facts it is pretty clear that the Heath Hen is among the
  birds the fate of which is sealed, and which, if not already exterminated
  or mixed with foreign blood, will soon have disappeared. The footnote in
  the Proceedings of the IV. International Ornithological Congress, p. 203,
  is herewith corrected.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>his</span> Quail, though a
  typical <i>Coturnix</i>, is easily distinguished from all other species.
  The male has the upper-side almost black, each feather bordered and
  indistinctly barred with rufous-brown, and with a wide, creamy white
  shaft-line. The throat and sides of the head are rufous-cinnamon, the
  feathers of the chest and breast at their basal half buff with a broken
  black cross-bar, the distal half black, with two pale buff spots near the
  tip, or with a continuous white border.</p>

  <p>This sole representative of the "gamebirds" in New Zealand was in
  former days very numerous in both islands, but especially so in the South
  Island, wherever there was open grass-land, but is now evidently extinct.
  Its disappearance is apparently not due to excessive shooting, but rather
  to the introduction of rats, cats, and dogs, and last, but not least, to
  bush-fires and to the regular burning of the sheep-runs, according to Sir
  Walter Buller. No doubt the establishment itself of extensive sheep-farms
  in the once, more or less, uninhabited grass-land was ominous for the
  future of the Quail.</p>

  <p>It is not quite clear when the Quail disappeared. The last on the
  North Island was shot by Captain Mair at Whangarei in 1860. Specimens
  were recorded in 1867 and 1869, but were apparently not procured. In
  Haast's "Journal of Exploration in the Nelson Province" it is said to be
  still very abundant in 1861 on the grassy plains of the interior.</p>

  <p>Sir Walter Buller mentions two specimens said to be from an island in
  Blue Skin Bay, shot in "1867 or 1868." In his Second Edition of the Birds
  of New Zealand he informs us that it was found occasionally in the South
  Island down to 1875, but in the "Supplement" he speaks of a specimen said
  to have been shot in 1871, but adds, "There is no absolute evidence of
  it," and "if true, this individual bird must have been about the last of
  its race." Therefore, evidently the note about 1875 was erroneous. <!--
  Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span></p>

  <p>The statement of Mr. Cheeseman, that he took eggs on Three Kings
  Islands is erroneous. The eggs belonged to a <i>Synoecus</i>, and the egg
  given to Sir Walter Buller is now in my collection.</p>

  <p>I have, however, also two eggs of <i>Coturnix novaezealandiae</i>,
  brought home by Dr. H. O. Forbes. They have a brownish-white shell,
  covered and washed all over with deep brown patches and lighter brown
  underlying markings. They show distinctly the character of Quails' eggs,
  but, besides being much larger, are easily distinguished from eggs of
  <i>Coturnix coturnix</i>. They measure 34.3 by 25 and 34.5 by 21.3
  mm.</p>

  <p>Of birds I have in my collection: One &#x2642; ad. Shot at Whangarei,
  North Island, by Major Mair, in 1860. (This is the specimen figured in
  the Second Edition of the "Birds of New Zealand." I bought it with Sir
  Walter Buller's collection eighteen years ago. By a curious <i>lapsus
  memoriae</i> Sir Walter Buller, in the "Supplement," p. 35, in 1905,
  states that this bird was in his son's collection.) One &#x2640; ad. and
  one &#x2642; in the first year's plumage, shot by Messrs. Walter Buller
  and E. French near Kaiapoi, South Island, in the summer of 1859.</p>

  <p>Seven specimens are in the British Museum, the types in Paris, three
  in Cambridge, a pair in Christchurch in New Zealand, some in the
  Canterbury Museum, and doubtless many others, most of which have never
  been recorded.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> first announcement
  of the former existence of large Struthious birds in New Zealand was made
  by Mr. J. S. Polack in 1838. In his book <i>New Zealand</i>, he states
  that he found large bird bones near East Cape in the North Island. The
  first specimen, however, that came into the hands of a scientific man was
  the bone sent to Professor Owen in 1839 by Mr. Rule, who reported that
  the natives had told him that it was the bone of a large Eagle which they
  called "<i>Movie</i>." Professor Owen, with his extraordinary knowledge,
  at once saw that far from any connection with the <i>Raptores</i>, Mr.
  Rule's bone was a portion of a femur of a gigantic Struthious bird. He
  described it on November 12th, 1839, at a meeting of the Zoological
  Society, and it was figured on Plate 3 of Volume III of the Transactions
  of the Zoological Society.</p>

  <p>The next notice of the Moas takes the form of a letter, received by
  Professor Owen from the Rev. W. C. Cotton, dated Waimate, near the Bay of
  Islands, New Zealand, July 11th, 1842; and in it the writer gives an
  account of his meeting with the Rev. Mr. Wm. Williams, a fellow
  missionary at East Cape. The latter had collected a lot of "Moa" bones
  and sent them to a Dr. Buckland. Mr. Williams also reported a
  conversation with two Englishmen, who declared they had been taken out by
  a native at night and had seen a Moa alive, but had been too frightened
  to shoot it.</p>

  <p>On January 24th, 1843, Professor Owen exhibited a number of bones from
  Mr. Williams' collection, and described them, giving the bird the name of
  "<i>Megalornis novaezealandiae</i>," afterwards changing the generic
  title into <i>Dinornis</i>, as <i>Megalornis</i> was preoccupied.
  Afterwards, when describing these bones and those contained in the second
  box of Mr. Williams' collection more fully, he somewhat inconsistently
  changed the specific name to <i>struthioides</i>, which Captain Hutton,
  in his later classification, retained. Following the laws of priority,
  however (<i>novaezealandiae</i> has 10 months' priority over
  <i>struthioides</i>), we must reinstate the name
  <i>novaezealandiae</i>.</p>

  <p>A number of other finds occurred between 1842 and 1847, but by far the
  largest and most important collections were made and sent home between
  1847 and 1852 by the Hon. W. Mantell, who sent to Professor Owen many
  hundreds of bones and eggshells, from which the Professor was enabled to
  determine and describe a large number of species, and even as early as
  this to separate some genera. <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span></p>

  <p>The bulk of later finds were made by Sir Julius von Haast, Captain
  Hutton, and Mr. Aug. Hamilton, and the two most famous deposits were
  Glenmark Swamp and Te Aute; but it would take too much space to give here
  an account of all the other extraordinary discoveries of Moa deposits
  made by such men as Dr. Thomson, Mr. Earl, Mr. Thorne, Dr. H. O. Forbes,
  and many others. Besides many fragments of eggshell, a number of eggs
  have been found, which will be enumerated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Feathers have been found at Clutha River, near Roxburgh, and also in
  caves near Queenstown. Those from Clutha are mostly dark, being black
  with white tips; while the Queenstown ones resemble feathers of
  <i>Apteryx australis</i> in colours. Professor Owen has shown that
  <i>Megalapteryx huttoni</i> was feathered down to the toes, and in the
  plate I have represented it clothed with feathers similar to the Clutha
  ones, which I believe belong to this species. The Moas at one time must
  have been extraordinarily numerous, both in numbers and species, and they
  varied in height from 2½ feet to 12 feet. Professor Parker has shown that
  some of the species had crests of long feathers on the head, and, as some
  adult skulls of the same forms show no signs of this, he infers that the
  males alone had this appendage. There has been much discussion as to the
  time when the Moas became extinct, and we know for certain that the two
  species, <i>Dinornis maximus</i> and <i>Anomalopteryx antiquus</i>,
  belong to a much earlier geological epoch than the bulk of the other
  species. It would be too lengthy for my purpose to go into the arguments,
  but we can, by the study of the "<i>kitchen middens</i>" of Maoris and
  their traditions, fairly adduce that the Maoris arrived in the North
  Island some 600 years ago, that they hunted Moas, and that they
  exterminated them about 100 to 150 years after their arrival. In the
  South, or rather Central, Island, the Maoris appear to have arrived about
  100 years later, and to have exterminated the Moas about 350 years ago.
  It is only fair to say, however, that Monsieur de Quatrefages adduces
  evidence in his paper which goes far to prove that Moas existed down to
  the end of the 18th or even beginning of the 19th century in those parts
  of the Middle Island not, or scantily, inhabited by Maoris.</p>

  <p>The <i>Dinornithidae</i> form a separate group of the order
  <i>Ratitae</i>, in no way closely related to the Australian Emu
  (<i>Dromaius</i>), as many ornithologists have asserted, but nearer to
  the South American Nandu (<i>Rhea</i>) than any other living
  <i>Ratitae</i>, though exhibiting many characters in common with the
  <i>Apterygidae</i>. There have been a number of classifications set up of
  this family. The first by Reichenbach, in 1850, with 7 species and 7
  genera! <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>The next was by Von Haast, in 1873, who
  enumerated 10 species, divided into 4 genera. The third was Lydekker's,
  in 1891, who acknowledged 23 species, divided into 5 genera. Then came
  Hutton's, in 1892, which left out <i>Megalapteryx</i>, with its then
  known 2 species, and acknowledged 26 species, divided into 7 genera.
  Lastly we have Professor Parker's, in 1895, in which again
  <i>Megalapteryx</i> is left out, and 21 species are acknowledged, divided
  into 5 genera. There has been a great amount of controversy as to the
  number of species of Moas which really ought to be distinguished, and of
  late years there has been a tendency to unite most of the species as
  synonyms, the authors declaring that bones vary to such a degree that all
  the characters relied on for the distinguishing of the various species
  were individual variations, and that, besides, it was impossible that so
  many distinct forms could have occurred in such a small area. The extreme
  of this lumping was reached when Professor Forbes, in the Bulletin of the
  Liverpool Museums, III, pp. 27 and 28 (1900), divided the Moas into six
  genera, each with a single species. He thus ignores the fact that by
  doing so he has united forms which were founded on <span class="sm">FULLY
  ADULT</span> bones, and yet some of them were only about half or
  two-thirds the size of the others. I personally think that too many
  species have been made, and at least 7 of Captain Hutton's forms must be
  sunk. On the other hand some have been described since 1895 and 1900, and
  I have been obliged to name others rather against my will, so that in
  spite of uniting so many species of others I find I am obliged to
  acknowledge more species than anyone else. I have divided these into
  genera according to Professor Parker's classification, only adding
  <i>Palaeocasuarius</i> of Forbes, with 3 species, and
  <i>Megalapteryx</i>, with 5, which brings my number up to 38 species,
  divided into 7 genera. My reasons for not uniting these into 7 species
  and 7 genera, as those of the "lumping school" do, are
  twofold,&mdash;first, the bones of the <i>Ratitae</i> are much more solid
  than those of other birds, and are not given to so much individual
  variation; and, secondly, in the face of the great number of species of
  Paradise Birds and Cassowaries found on New Guinea, the contention that
  there could not be so many species of Moa on so small an area is not
  easily maintained. Moreover, we have strong support in the present fauna
  and flora for the presumption that, when the Moas first came into
  existence and differentiated into species, New Zealand was a much larger
  area, stretching at least from the Macquarie Islands in the south to the
  Kermadecs in the north, and from Lord Howe's Island on the west to the
  Chatham Islands on the east. So that, like the giant tortoises on the
  Galápagos Islands, <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page188"></a>{188}</span>they only got driven so closely together
  after their specific differentiation, when the land gradually subsided,
  owing to volcanic action. The differentiation of the family is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<h5 class="lg125">DINORNITHIDAE.</h5>

  <p>Skull with a short and wide beak. Pectoral girdle very small or
  absent, wing absent, only an indication in <i>Dinornis dromioides</i>.
  Hallux absent or present. An extension bridge to the tibio-tarsus, which
  is placed near the inner border of the bone. No superior notch to the
  sternum. Most of the species of very large size. The tarso-metatarsus is
  either long and slender or short and wide, and its anterior surface may
  or may not be grooved. The second trochlea is longer than the fourth, the
  third is not pedunculated, and there is no perforation in the groove
  between the third and fourth trochlea. In the tibio-tarsus the cnemial
  crest rises well above the head; the extensor groove is separated by a
  considerable interval from the inner border of the bone. There is a
  well-defined intercondylar tubercle; the intercondylar gorge is deep, and
  there is no deep pit on the lateral surface of the entocondyle. The femur
  may be either slender or stout, but is not markedly curved forwards. The
  popliteal depression is deep, and the summit of the great trochanter
  rises considerably above the level of the head. The pelvis approximates
  to that of the <i>Apterygidae</i>, but the pectineal process of the pubis
  is less developed, and the ischium and pubis may be longer and more
  slender. The coracoid and scapula are aborted and may be absent. The
  sternum, which may be either long and narrow, or broad and short, differs
  from that of the <i>Apterygidae</i> by the absence of the superior notch,
  the divergent lateral processes, and the reduction of the coracoidal
  grooves to small facets or their total disappearance. The cervical
  vertebrae are relatively short, an expanded neural platform as far as the
  sixth.</p>

  <p>In <i>Anomalopteryx</i> and <i>Megalapteryx</i> the number of cervical
  vertebrae is 21, and there are 2 cervico-dorsal and 4 free dorsal
  vertebrae, so it is fair to assume that this is the correct number
  throughout the family.</p>

  <p>The feathers had after-shafts.</p>

  <p>I have adopted Professor Parker's classification in the genera, only
  substituting <i>Cela</i> Reichenbach for <i>Mesapteryx</i> Hutton, which
  is a synonym of <i>Megalapteryx</i> Haast. As to the species I have used
  my own judgment; I felt obliged to name a number of species acknowledged
  by Parker and Lydekker but not named, because this system of indicating
  species by the letters A, B, C, &amp;c., which has crept into our
  nomenclature, will make all understanding impossible, as not always the
  same species is denoted by the same letter. A few of these species will
  naturally later have to be sunk, as some have been founded on skulls and
  others on leg bones, or so, which, when we get perfect individual
  skeletons may prove to be identical, but I do not think these will be
  many.</p>

  <p>Besides a number of imperfect eggs, particulars of which will be found
  in Dr. A. B. Meyer's article in the Ibis, 1903, pp. 188-196, there are

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> skull is broad and
  much depressed, with a comparatively wide, somewhat pointed and deflected
  beak. Breadth at the squamosals twice the height at basi-temporal. It has
  a flattened frontal region, and a wide median ridge on the upper surface
  of the praemaxillae. The mandible is in the form of a narrow <span
  class="ssb">U</span>, with the angle much inflected, no distinct
  anticular process, and the symphysis moderately wide, narrowing
  anteriorly, with a prominent and broad inferior ridge, widest in front.
  The quadrate is elongated, with a very large pneumatic foramen. The
  sternum is nearly as long as broad, very convex, with distinct coracoidal
  facets, 3 costal articulations, very small and reflected costal
  processes, the lateral processes very broad and widely divergent, and a
  wide xiphisternal notch. The pelvis is narrow with a high ilium, in which
  the inferior border of the postacetabular portion is flat, and does not
  descend as a sharp ridge below the level of the anterior postacetabular
  vertebrae. The pubis has a small pectineal process; and the ventral
  aspect of the true and postacetabular vertebrae is very broad and much
  flattened.</p>

  <p>The distal extremity of the tibio-tarsus is not inflected. A hallux is
  present in some species. The tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus are long
  and slender, the length of the latter equalling and more often exceeding
  the length of the femur, and also exceeding half the length of the
  tibio-tarsus. The femur is comparatively long and slender, with a short
  neck, the head rising but slightly and projecting only a small distance,
  the linear aspera in the form of a long irregular line, the outer side of
  the distal extremity moderately expanded, the popliteal depression small,
  deep, and sharply defined, the profile of the inner condyle semi-ovoid
  and narrow, and the interior trochlear surface nearly flat. The
  phalangeals of the pes are long and comparatively slender, the proximal
  surface of the terminal segments not being trefoil-shaped. In the
  vertebral column the middle cervicals are long and narrow, with the
  postzygapophyses directed much outwardly and separated by a very deep
  channel, and the posterior face of the centrum low and wide. The dorsals
  have short transverse processes and neural spine, the anterior and middle
  ones (those with a haemal spine or carina) having a large anterior
  pneumatic foramen between the nib-facet, the foramen being triangular in
  shape. All the species of this genus are of comparatively large size, and
  include the tallest members of the family.</p>

  distinguished by Haast from the <i>Dinornithidae</i> as an ancient form
  of the <i>Apterygidae</i>, but afterwards united by Lydekker with the
  <i>Dinornithidae</i>. Mr. Lydekker's diagnosis of the genus is as <span
  class="nw">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"Distinguished from <i>Dinornis</i> by the extreme slenderness and
  length of the femur and tibio-tarsus, and the relatively shorter
  tarso-metatarsus, of which latter the length is considerably shorter than
  that of the femur. The pelvis is much narrower than in Dinornis, with the
  ventral surface of the postacetabular sacrals ridged and narrower, and a
  more developed pectineal process to the pubis. The femur is markedly
  curved forwards, with the distal extremity moderately expanded, the
  popliteal depression larger and less defined, the linea aspera narrower
  and sharper, and a more distinct anterior intermuscular ridge."</p>

  <p>The following additional diagnostic characters are taken from Mr.
  Charles W. Andrews' description of the complete skeleton of
  <i>Megalapteryx tenuipes</i> in the Tring Museum (Nov. Zool. IV, pp.
  188-194, fig. 1-2 in text and pl. VI):&mdash;</p>

  <p>Width of cranium at paroccipital processes less than half the length
  of the basis cranii. Length of premaxilla less than two-and-a-half times
  that of the basis cranii. Body of the premaxilla pointed and slightly
  decurved; its length and breadth less than the basis cranii. The
  occipital plane slightly declined backwards. Occipital condyle projecting
  slightly beyond the paroccipital processes. Anterior and posterior
  lambdoidal ridges separated by a very narrow interval in their middle
  region only. Width at squamosals slightly more than double the length of
  the basis cranii. Mammillary tuberosities not very prominent. Margin of
  tympanic cavity evenly curved. Temporal fossae very large. The distance
  between the temporal ridges about four-fifths the width of the cranium at
  the fossae. The posterior temporal ridge confluent with the lambdoidal
  ridge. Post-temporal fossae very large.</p>

  <p>The inferior temporal ridge is strongly marked, and there is a
  pretympanic process. The zygomatic process is well developed. Rostrum
  dilated towards its anterior end, compressed and carinate beneath the
  large presphenoid fossae. Mandible very slender. Posterior angular
  process small. Sternum very convex, and with a very nearly straight
  anterior border between the tuberosities for the coracoscapular
  ligaments. Costal processes short but large, with distinct <!-- Page 196
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>coracoidal
  facets. The lateral processes are long and distally expanded. The sternum
  is just as wide as it is long. There are three costal articulations. The
  most notable character is the enormous length of the toes, the middle one
  being longer than the tarso-metatarsus. The ungual phalanges are
  peculiarly long, narrow and curved, instead of being comparatively short
  and broad, as in most other Moas.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> synonymy of this
  form is somewhat confused, but I think it is clear that <i>huttonii</i>
  of Owen is its proper name. Professor Owen (Ext. B. p. 430) says:</p>

  <p>"In the collection from the Glenmark Swamp, South Island, are bones
  that scarcely differ, save in size, from the dimensions (? <span
  class="sm">W.R.</span>) of the type bones of <i>Dinornis didiformis</i>
  from the <span class="sc">North Island</span>. They are noted as of a
  large variety of that species." Captain Hutton remarks: "The bones that I
  have arranged under the name <i>D. didiformis</i> belong probably to a
  new species. The tibia is well marked and quite distinct, but the femur
  and metatarsus, that I have associated with it, pass almost into <i>D.
  casuarinus</i>, but are rather smaller. <i>D. casuarinus</i> is
  undoubtedly a good species, easily distinguished by its tibia." Possibly
  the <i>Dinornis</i> of the <span class="sc">South Island</span>, with the
  tibia characteristic of <i>D. didiformis</i> of the <span
  class="sc">North Island</span>, may need to be noted for the convenience
  of naming the bones as <i>Dinornis huttonii</i>.</p>

  <p>When describing his <i>D. didinus</i>, Professor Owen failed to
  recognise its identity with his previously named <i>D. huttonii</i>,
  doubtless owing to the leg bones being hidden by the dry integument. This
  being the case, it is necessary to reinstate the name <i>huttonii</i>, as
  it has four years' priority over <i>didinus</i>.</p>

  <p>Captain Hutton says that a few bones of this form have been obtained
  in the North Island at Poverty Bay and Te Aute; but I am convinced he is
  in error and that these bones are aberrant individual bones of <i>A.
  didiformis</i> and that <i>M. huttonii</i> is confined to the South or
  rather Middle Island. The plate of this species has been reconstructed by
  Mr. Lodge from the mummified remains which form the type specimen of
  <i>Didornis didinus</i>, and the feathers found in the alluvial sands of
  the <span class="sc">Clutha River</span>. The type of <i>Dinornis
  didinus</i> was found at Queenstown by Mr. Squires.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Mr. C. W. Andrews, in his description of my complete skeleton of
  <i>Megalapteryx tenuipes</i> has shown that Owen's type specimens of his
  <i>Dinornis didinus</i> are certainly of a species of the genus
  <i>Megalapteryx</i>, and closely <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>allied to <i>M.
  tenuipes</i>. Mr. Andrews, however, throws some doubt as to whether the
  pelvis and femora, referred to this species by Hutton, really belong to
  it.</p>

  <p>A complete egg which I consider must be of this species is preserved
  in the Tring Museum. Its measurements are as <span

  <p>This egg was dredged up on the Molyneux River, near Otago, during gold
  dredging operations in 1901; a second perfect egg was dredged up a few
  months before in the same river, and was referred by Dr. Benham to

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> skull is narrow
  and vaulted, with a long, sharp and slightly deflected beak. Breadth at
  the squamosals 1½ times the height at basi-temporal, which has a
  constricted praemaxillary ridge, and the quadrate with a very small
  pneumatic foramen. The mandible is <span class="ssb">V</span>-shaped,
  with a slight inflection of the angle, and a distinct postarticular
  process. The symphysis is very narrow and pointed, with a long and narrow
  inferior ridge, not expanding markedly at either extremity. The sternum
  is longer, flatter and narrower than in <i>Dinornis</i>, having no
  distinct xiphisternal notch, three costal articulations, long and narrow
  costal processes, slender lateral processes which are often elongated,
  and usually no coracoidal facets. The pelvis is wider and lower than in
  <i>Dinornis</i>, with the lower border of the postacetabular portion of
  the ilium descending as a sharp ridge much below the level of the sacral
  ribs, and without any distinct pectineal process. A hallux is present.
  The tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus are relatively shorter and stouter
  than in <i>Dinornis</i>, the latter being shorter than the femur, which
  is usually stouter and relatively shorter than in <i>Megalapteryx</i>.
  The length of the tarso-metatarsus is less than half that of the
  tibio-tarsus. The femur, besides being usually relatively shorter is
  readily distinguished from that of <i>Dinornis</i> by its more expanded
  extremities, the rather longer neck, and the much larger and ill-defined
  popliteal depression.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are of the general type of those of <i>Pachyornis</i>,
  but the anterior pneumatic foramen commences in the third dorsal. The
  phalangeals are intermediate between those of <i>Dinornis</i> and
  <i>Pachyornis</i>. Haast considered that the coracoid was aborted and
  often absent in this genus, in <i>Emeus</i>, and <i>Pachyornis</i>. As
  additional characters of the skull it may be mentioned that there is a
  prominent supra-occipital protuberance, and a depression on the squamosal
  above the quadrate; the par-occipital processes are pointed, and the
  basi-occipital processes only slightly prominent; so that the posterior
  profile of the basi-occipital is nearly straight. The quadrate has a very
  short anterior process.</p>

  prominence, and no well-marked depression upon the frontal aspect of the
  squamosal above the head of the quadrate. The basi-occipital tubercles

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> skull is either
  vaulted or flattened, with a sharp and narrow beak. The paroccipital
  processes are shorter and more rounded, and the basi-occipital tubercles
  more prominent than in <i>Anomalopteryx</i>, while the quadrate and
  mandible resemble the same bones in that genus somewhat closely. The
  sternum is flat and very broad and short, with no coracoidal facets, a
  very small xiphisternal notch, broad and short costal processes, and
  widely divergent lateral processes; while there are only two costal
  articulations. The pelvis is extremely low and wide, with the anterior
  wall of the acetabulum very deeply concave, the ventral surface of all
  the vertebrae behind the true sacrals narrow and convex, and from which
  the very broad sacral ribs ascend to join the ilium, of which the
  inferior postacetabular border is very sharp, and descends far below the
  level of the ribs. There is no pectineal process to the pubis. The
  tibio-tarsus is very short, with the shaft curved outwards, the distal
  extremity markedly inflected, and the fibular ridge much shorter than in
  the other genera. The fibular border below the smooth space at the distal
  extremity of the fibular ridge is extremely rough; and the distal
  extensor tubercle is very prominent, being situated partly on the line of
  the upper half of the extensor groove, instead of being altogether
  external to the same.</p>

  <p>The tarso-metatarsus is still shorter and wider than in <i>Emeus</i>,
  the width at the middle of the shaft being usually rather more than one
  third of the length. The third trochlea is more prominent than in the
  other genera, and rises very abruptly from the shaft, the outer border of
  the anterior surface usually expanding suddenly at the proximal
  extremity, and the outer ridge of this surface being always more
  prominent than the inner, whereas in the other genera the opposite
  condition obtains. The femur, as compared with that of <i>Dinornis</i>,
  is very much shorter and thicker, with a longer neck, and the head rising
  and projecting very considerably, the linea aspera mainly forming a rough
  nodule near the distal end of the shaft, the outer surface of the distal
  extremity more suddenly expanded, and the popliteal depression larger,
  more open, and leading to the inner surface of the shaft by a more
  distinct channel. The profile of the inner condyle is wider
  antero-posteriorly, and more rounded, the anterior intertrochlear surface
  being deeply channelled.</p>

  <p>The phalangeals of the pes are much shorter and stouter than in
  <i>Dinornis</i>, the proximal surface of the terminal segments generally
  presenting a trefoil-shaped contour. The length of the tarso-metatarsus
  is very much <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>less than half that of the tibio-tarsus.
  In the vertebral column the cervicals are short with very stout centra,
  the prezygopophyses in the middle region being nearly horizontal and
  separated from one another by a wide channel. The posterior face of the
  centra is tall and narrow, and the neural spines of the last two
  vertebrae much inclined forward. In the dorsals there is usually no
  anterior pneumatic foramen till the fourth (or the last with a distinct
  haemal carina), this foramen being situated on the line of the anterior
  border of the rib-facet. The third and fourth dorsals are extremely
  compressed. Throughout the series also the neural spines and transverse
  processes are comparatively long. Additional characters of the skull are
  that the sphenoidal rostrum is expanded in a lance-like shape at the
  anterior extremity, in a manner unlike that of any of the other
  genera.</p>

  <p>Then the supraoccipital never has a very strongly developed median
  prominence, and the temporal fossae are comparatively short. The mandible
  may be readily distinguished from that of the other genera by the low
  position of the inner aperture of the dental canal, which pierces the
  bone obliquely to join the small lateral vacuity.</p>

  extensor muscles run along the inner side of the bone as in
  <i>Casuarius</i>. As in the latter genus it takes a marked turn inwards
  and backwards before joining the epicnemial crest, while a line joining
  the centre point between the distal condyles and the epicnemial ridge
  leaves a considerable space between it and the wall of the groove. There
  is no intercondylar eminence in the intercondylar channel, and the
  orifice of the extensor foramen opens more longitudinally than in the
  other genera, and points downwards."</p>

<h5 class="lg150 mt8">AEPYORNITHIDAE.</h5>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">T</span>he</span> first notice we
  have from a scientific man of the existence on Madagascar of large
  Struthious birds is the description by Isidore Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire of
  two eggs and a few osseous remains, in the Annales des Sciences
  naturelles III, Zoologie, vol. XIV (1850). These important objects were
  sent to the describer by a colonist of Réunion, Monsieur de Malavois, but
  were obtained from the natives in Madagascar by Captain M. Abadie. A
  third egg arrived smashed. The name given on this evidence was
  <i>Aepyornis maximus</i>.</p>

  <p>Since then some 40 eggs at least and a large number of odd bones have
  been collected by Monsieur Grandidier, Messrs. Last and others, and Dr.
  Forsyth Major, but only one practically complete, and one less complete
  skeleton of a smaller species, named <i>Aepyornis hildebrandti</i> by Dr.
  Burckhardt.</p>

  <p>A large number of species has been diagnosed on the evidence of these
  bones and eggs by Professor Milne-Edwards, Mr. Dawson Rowley and Mr.
  Andrews, and a second genus, <i>Mullerornis</i>, established.</p>

  <p>The following is the diagnosis of the family</p>

<h5 class="lg125">AEPYORNITHIDAE.</h5>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">H</span>ead</span> less flattened
  than in the <i>Dinornithidae</i>, much longer and narrower. Brain case
  much greater in volume. Occipital condyle strongly pedunculate. Temporal
  fossae deep and narrow. The basisphenoid has on each side a well marked
  pterygoidal apophysis. The lower mandible is straight and stout,
  recalling somewhat that of <i>Rhea</i>, but the maxillary branches are
  higher and stouter. The symphysis is long, contracted, and hollowed out
  in the shape of a ladle. The sternum presents many affinities to that of
  <i>Apteryx</i>. It is a thin plastron, flattened, and much widened. The
  coracoidal articular surfaces similar to those of <i>Apteryx</i>. The
  Coraco-scapulars are feeble, and have so faint an articular surface that
  the humerus must have been rudimentary. Hallux absent, outer digit has
  five, the middle digit four, and the inner digit three phalanges.</p>

  <p>There are three genera and twelve species.</p>

  <p>A striking character is that in the genus <i>Aepyornis</i> the
  proximal extremity of the tarso-metatarsus is larger than the distal
  extremity, a feature not found in the majority of other birds.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Grandidier has expressly pointed out that <i>Aepyornis</i>
  had only three toes, I cannot, therefore, understand why Messrs. Lydekker
  and Evans both state that the hallux is present. <!-- Page 222 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span></p>

  <p>In spite of the researches of Messrs. Grandidier, Last, and Forsyth
  Major and the large collections sent home by them, the number of
  <i>Aepyornis</i> bones is infinitesimal compared with the vast masses of
  bones of the <i>Dinornithidae</i> contained in the museums. This paucity
  of material quite prohibits us from making a critical study of the
  described species, so that we are at present unable to say if too many or
  too few species have been diagnosed. I am inclined, however, to think
  that if we ever get complete skeletons of the larger forms, <i>Ae.
  grandidieri</i> and <i>Ae. cursor</i> will prove to be sexes of one
  species, and also <i>Ae. titan</i> and <i>Ae. maximus</i>. For the
  present, however, the measurements are too different to allow of their
  being united without further investigation.</p>

  follows: "It presents the same general characters, and evidently belongs
  to an <i>Aepyornis</i>, but to a different species, which we will call
  <i>Aepyornis medius</i>. The femur in question is not only distinguished
  by its lesser proportions but by the narrower external face of the bone;
  which variation results in causing the whole area between the trochanter
  and the base of the femoral neck to be much less depressed. The
  intermuscular line, which marks the insertion surface of the deep portion
  of the femoral triceps muscle, is hardly indicated, whereas it is very
  pronounced in the larger femur. The posterior side is also more rounded,
  and the distance which separates the popliteal depression from the
  proximal extremity is larger; the shape of this large depression is,
  however, the same as in the larger femur, and although the articular
  surfaces above it do show some differences, we know that these characters
  are not very reliable as they are subject to individual variations.</p>

  <p><span class="uc"><span class="di">I</span>t</span> is most unfortunate
  that the larger number of authors have neglected to go carefully into the
  synonymy of this bird; if they had done so it would not have been
  necessary, after 81 years, to reject the very appropriate name of
  <i>ater</i>, and to rename the Emu of Kangaroo Island. Vieillot, in the
  Nouveau Dictionnaire D'Histoire Naturelle X, page 212, distinctly states
  that his <i>Dromaius ater</i> was a name given to Latham's <i>Casuarius
  novaehollandiae</i>, and makes no mention of Péron or of the Isle
  Decrès.</p>

  <p>The figures in Péron's work of the adult male and female are not good,
  but those of the young and nestlings appear to me to be very accurate,
  and the plate in the Galérie des Oiseaux is quite excellent. The latter
  and my own are taken from the type specimen in the Paris Museum, while
  the plate in Péron was done by Lessieur from a series of sketches from
  life made by himself on Decrès Island and in the menagerie of the Jardin
  des Plantes. The only known specimens of this extinct species are the
  mounted skin and skeleton in Paris and the skeleton in the Florence
  Museum. All these are what remain of the three living birds brought to
  Paris by Péron, and no other authentic specimens exist anywhere. There is
  in the Museum at Liverpool a full-grown, though immature Emu of the same
  size as <i>Dromaius peronii</i>, but owing to its proportionally longer
  legs and very scanty plumage it is not absolutely safe to identify it as
  a second mounted specimen of <i>D. peronii</i>. I will recur to this
  lower down.</p>

  <p>Description of adult male (ex Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.): Similar to <i>D.
  novaehollandiae</i>, but much smaller, and with feathers of the neck
  entirely black; feathers of the body brown fulvous, with the apical half
  very dark blackish brown; bill and feet blackish, naked skin of the sides
  of the neck blue. Total length about 55 inches, tarsus 11.40, culmen
  2.36.</p>

  <p>Immature in first plumage entirely sooty black. Nestling whitish with
  longitudinal bands of rufous brown. In addition to Decrès or Kangaroo
  Island, also Flinders, King Islands, and Tasmania had Emus living on them
  <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>{236}</span>at the time of Péron's visit, and I
  believe, if authentic specimens from these localities were in existence
  we should find that each of these islands had had a distinct species or
  race of Emus. Taking this for granted, and also taking into account that
  it is slightly different from the type of <i>D. peronii</i>, I have come
  to the conclusion that the Liverpool specimen is an immature, though
  full-grown individual from one of these other islands; but it is not
  possible from this one rather poor specimen to separate it from the
  Kangaroo Island species, especially as there is absolutely no indication
  of the origin of this specimen.</p>

  <p>Habitat: Island of Decrès or Kangaroo Island.</p>

  <p>One stuffed specimen (Type) and one skeleton in Paris, one skeleton in
  Florence, and one stuffed specimen in Liverpool (an species diversa?).
  Also some leg-bones in Adelaide, Australia.</p>

  <p>Dr. H. O. Forbes, who kindly lent me the last-named specimen, was the
  first to point out the differences of this bird from <i>D.
  novaehollandiae</i>. It is certainly totally distinct from birds of
  similar age of either <i>D. novaehollandiae</i> or <i>D. n.
  irroratus</i>. <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
